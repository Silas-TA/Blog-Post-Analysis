Wheelbarrow —This has to be right up there with one of the handiest tools imaginable. A wheelbarrow hauls soil, rocks, sand, lumber, weeds, harvested food, etc. It basically does everything but fold the laundry. I guess you could get away without owning one, but why would you? "

Round-point or spade shovel —I have searched far and wide and found that everyone has a different name for every shovel shape. And they don’t all agree. Instead of the official names, I’ll tell you what it looks like and you can name it, okay?  This is the shovel everyone seems to have in his/her garage or rusting outside behind . It has a long handle, and the end of the shovel has sloping sides that gradually come to a point. These are handy for digging, planting trees and shrubs, cutting through sod, prying up rocks, dividing perennials, and digging trenches. This guy gets extra points if its metal shoulders are bent to create a foot rest for digging. "

Square shovel —Like the round-point shovel, I give up on its “real” name—I promise, there are several. This is a long-handled shovel whose business end is square metal. It’s perfect for scooping things like soil, gravel, rocks, or sand and getting them from one place to another. It is also handy for mixing cement. "

Long-handled hoe —This tool has to be one of my very favorite tools hands-down. Weeds tend to take over quickly, but if you just run a hoe in between the plants one or two times a week, it makes quick work of the sneaky little so-and-sos. Hoes show up differently, so the metal at the end may come in a variety of shapes.  There’s what I call the “original” hoe—the one that has a solid piece of flat rectangular metal on the end of it. This works just fine. But my personal favorite is the one that I like to call . It’s made with a sharp metal frame creating the rectangle. (I’ve heard people call it the “stirrup hoe.”) With this one, the thin metal lies flat into the soil, slides underneath the unsuspecting weed, and slices it off at the soil line. "

Handheld hoe —This little guy is designed like the original hoe as well as the hoe of death, but it has a short handle so you can get up close and personal with your plants’ weedy enemies. What’s extra handy is that like using dental floss, you can get to those hard-to-reach places without disturbing the rest of the crop. "
6,https://www.finegardening.com/article/basic-gardening-tools-101,Basic Gardening Tools 101 - FineGardening,6. Garden fork,"6. Garden fork —Forks can help cut into heavy soil and sometimes work much easier than a solid-bladed tool (say, a shovel). Garden forks loosen the soil, not lift it. They are great for mixing materials into the soil, turning compost piles, and harvesting root crops like carrots and potatoes. They’re also perfect for cleaning the bedding out of chicken houses and coops. Garden forks have a multitude of names, and from what I can tell, this is mostly due to differences in the fork, usually in the number or the weight.  English cultivating forks have thin, square tines, while the traditional fork tines are broad and flat. Both work well, but some people prefer the English version for tilling and aerating the soil. There are new types of forks being marketed everyday, so I honestly can’t keep up. I have one I use for everything. "

8,https://www.finegardening.com/article/basic-gardening-tools-101,Basic Gardening Tools 101 - FineGardening,8. Garden rake,"8. Garden rake —There are (for the most part) two kinds of rakes. One is used to rake leaves, which I guess is handy but not a necessity. The one that I consider a must-have is the garden rake. It’s the one people leave lying around so that when you step on it the handle comes up and smacks you in the face.  If you happen to be one of those uber-cool people who have never experienced this phenomenon, the garden rake is the one with the long handle and short, curved metal tines on the end. It is great for spreading mulch, thinning your seedlings, leveling ground, creating raised beds, erasing footprints, and gathering debris. Oh, and I rake my leaves with it too. "
9,https://www.finegardening.com/article/basic-gardening-tools-101,Basic Gardening Tools 101 - FineGardening,9. Pruning shears or pruners,"9. Pruning shears or pruners —These are those handheld little jobbies you keep in your purse or in the glove box because you’ll need a pair on you at all times. Pruning shears are available in two styles. There’s the bypass version, which cuts like a pair of scissors. Then there’s the straight-blade type, where a blade closes down onto a plate. My favorite is the bypass pruners because the cut feels cleaner. But to each their own. "

11,https://www.finegardening.com/article/basic-gardening-tools-101,Basic Gardening Tools 101 - FineGardening,11. Lopping shears,"11. Lopping shears —You either seriously need these or you don’t need them at all. Lopping shears work like pruning shears whose trainer had slipped them a couple of steroids. They’re mainly for cutting big branches, dense shrubs, and the like. So if you’re just growing lettuce and some root crops, fugheddaboudit. But if you happen to be into fruit trees, buy two.  Last and quite possibly least:     "
13,https://www.finegardening.com/article/basic-gardening-tools-101,Basic Gardening Tools 101 - FineGardening,12. Garden gloves,"—Well, this is kind of obvious, right? If you want to protect your delicate hands from eventually looking like witches feet, may I gently guide you in a gloved direction? Gloves also protect against undesirable pathogens in the soil and offer protection from cuts and scrapes.  That said, I’m telling tell you right now that I don’t like—nor do I wear—gardening gloves. Nothing comes between me and the dirt, baby. That said, most normal gardeners appreciate what gloves can do for their hands and that they help you save money that might otherwise be spent on fancy lotions.  If I had to wear gloves (like if a doctor said I would die a horrible death if I didn’t), I would choose those that fit like a second layer of skin. They come in colors that make your girlish heart sing, and your hands can at least feel something . Kinda."
1,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,Folding pruning saw,"Folding pruning saw  The tool I couldn’t be without is my folding pruning saw by Silky. I was introduced to them when I was training at RHS Garden Wisley as a student some 14 years ago and immediately bought one, and now could never be working in the garden without it. There is nothing more satisfying than making an accurate, clean, good-quality pruning cut , and I find this is the answer. The blade tends to last me around a year and then it can easily be replaced. I use them for all manner of pruning, such as shrub pruning , dead-wooding and lifting the lower branches of trees . Their shape and style means you can get into the smallest of places, while still doing a great job, and the blade can lock into a second position that almost bends back on itself for the most awkward of spaces. To date, I’ve never bent or snapped the blade which can happen with some pruning saws – a sure sign of a quality pruning saw.  Here's our pick of the best pruning saws  Derry Watkins "
2,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,Carbon blade scissors,"Carbon blade scissors  I have a gardening bumbag with labels, pens, string and most importantly my florist’s scissors . I don’t go out for even five minutes in the garden without it. I can’t bear to waste time looking for a tool, so I do almost all my gardening with these carbon steel florist’s scissors. They are strong and sharp (carbon steel takes a better edge than stainless steel, and can be sharpened up again). With the points together my scissors root out dandelions , tease out seedlings to be replanted, or extricate weeds from between gnarled roots. Holding them flat to the ground and scuffling them back and forth, you can use them as a mini- hoe . They will cut almost anything a pair of secateurs would, up to about 5mm. For anything bigger I have to get the loppers , so it often doesn’t get done. Before I organised the bumbag, I used to have them in my hip pocket (your leg won’t bend far enough back for them to poke you). The important thing is having them to hand.  Looking for loppers?   I first saw it in use many years ago on my first visit to Japan, being used to cut rice crops in the paddy fields  Roy Lancaster  Fergus Garrett "
3,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,Boards,"Boards  We are on heavy clay at Great Dixter , and even though the ground has been gardened for more than 100 years, border work can turn into a slimy mess at the turn of a cloud. Crushed horticultural grit comes to the rescue, making the soil easier to handle, as does dollops of compost , which increases the friability of the soil allowing it to take more abuse from feet, knees and tools in wet weather. But total protection comes from boards. These spread your weight and allow access into the borders without putting too much pressure on the ground. They also cover up areas that have been opened up prior to planting, deflecting the rain, and allowing you immediate access to the soil without waiting for the ground to dry. We have wide ones, thin ones, long ones and short ones, all raided (with permission) from skips and left over from building works. Some hang around for years and become recognisable by their ragged edges and become favourites. I can’t imagine gardening without them.

4,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,Japanese rice cutter,"Japanese rice cutter  My favourite tool is a Japanese rice cutter, a hand held tool comprising a light wooden handle and a curved steel blade, the inner edge of which is sharply serrated. I first saw it in use many years ago on my first visit to Japan, being used to cut rice crops in the paddy fields and I was fascinated by the ease with which the blade sliced the rice stems. One of my Japanese companions persuaded a harvester to part with his blade, which I managed to bring home in my hold baggage. I’ve since seen them for sale in agricultural suppliers, garden centres even. I found an immediate use for it in my garden when removing dead or unwanted top growth of perennials , especially those with leathery, prickly or otherwise obstinate growth, such as the dead leaves of dieramas. As with all such cuttings tools I wipe the blade clean after use and apply a thin coat of oil to protect it against rust .  Don't miss our round up of the best garden knives  Tom Coward "
5,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,Weeding trowel,"Weeding trowel  This is a tool that I learned about while guest gardening at Chanticleer, in Pennsylvania, USA about ten years ago. The thing that impressed me the most was its versatility; it can be used as a trowel for normal weeding but it’s also very strong and so is perfect for more robust weeds, such as ash seedlings and brambles. Because it is quite narrow, it is also useful for planting plug plants and weeding in paving cracks or between rocks; and the serrated edge makes it useful for sawing through roots when dividing perennials. After using the tool for a month at Chanticleer, my host must have seen what fun I was having with it and so kindly gave it to me as souvenir. At Gravetye Manor in Sussex with an extensive kitchen garden, herbaceous borders, meadow and orchard area to look after, I have probably used it almost every day.  Becky Crowley "
6,https://www.gardensillustrated.com/features/tools-experts-must-have,The garden tools the experts use - Gardens Illustrated,String line,"The cutting garden at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire comprises one third of the three-acre kitchen garden . The string-line is a vital tool to ensuring that I plant my flowers in rows in a similar style to the vegetables being grown in the rest of the kitchen garden. I usually plant into 1-1.2m wide beds, so a post will go into the ground at each end of a bed pulling the string taught and giving me a straight line to plant along. I then move the line along until the bed has been filled with three or four rows, depending on the ultimate size of the plants. This particular string-line was made by my colleagues years ago out of two metal stakes that originally formed part of the Chatsworth garden sign posts. The baler twine usually lasts a good few years before needing to be replaced – something that needs to be done this year before the next planting frenzy begins.

1,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/best-oil-for-garden-tools,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Best Oil for Garden Tools,"     There is no more important thing you can do to help you garden tools last and is also one of the simplest...oil your garden tools. With this simple step, you can prevent rust on the metal portion of the tool and when applied to any wood element, you’ll prevent drying and cracking.  While I will never be called a garden tool maintenance freak, the simple fact that I oil our tools makes up for my occasional neglect. Ultimately, if I had took the time to wash and dry my tools after every use, they would be better off. But, the reality is that after a long day of gardening all I want to do is shower and put my feet up…sound familiar?  Rust is caused by a chemical reaction that happens when iron (steel), water and oxygen come together...called oxidation. By coating the steel, you're blocking the oxygen and water and thus preventing rust.  For a lot of years motor oil has used as a rust preventative on garden tools and is still in practice today. You’ve probably read or been told to get a bucket of sand, pour some motor oil in it and poke your tools into it. Well, that will keep your tools from rusting, but what about the next time you stab that tool in your soil? You just transferred that oil from the bucket to the soil you’re trying to grow plants in.  So, which oil? Boiled Linseed Oil. Linseed oil is derived from the dried seeds of the flax plant and therefore a great eco alternative to any petroleum based oil. Gardeners have been using linseed oil for many, many years to protect their tools from the elements and at Garden Tool Co., we oil every tool that does not have a finish on it already, before it ships.  A cautionary note: The boiled linseed oil that is available today has a small amount of solvent added to it to keep it from hardening in the can, so after you apply it to your metal and wood, let it dry completely before using your tool, (about 24 hours) that way the solvent will have evaporated. Read and understand the direction on can. (Linseed oil is available in the paint dept. at Lowes, Home Depot and maybe your local hardware or paint store.)  Please click here see our Garden Tool Care and Maintenance article for step by step instructions. "
2,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/garden-tool-care-and-maintenance,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Garden Tool Care and Maintenance,"    Take care of your garden tools and they will take care of you! Well, that’s easy to say but if you’re like me, the last thing I want to do after a day of gardening is clean and oil my garden tools...my mind is clearly set on showering and putting my feet up with something cold to drink.  Seriously, your garden tools will last a lot longer (especially wood handles) if you show them a little love every once in a while, so take a little time to clean, sand, sharpen and oil your garden tools.    Clean - Round up all your tools, a bucket of warm water and a wire or stiff bristle brush. Start with the brush and knock off the majority of the dirt on your tools. Once you have the dirt removed, scrub the remaining of with the warm water. Then rinse and let them air dry or wipe them with a towel.  Sand - Once your garden tools are dry, it’s a good time to sand any wood handles. Moisture, whether it’s from water in the soil, dew or rain will raise the grain of the wood, making it feel rough. Gardeners that live in high humidity regions will also see/feel this “grain raising” more often. Just about any sandpaper will work for this, but I suggest starting out with an 80 grit paper and finishing off with a 120-150 grit for a nice smooth handle surface.  Also, now is a good time to take care of any rust on your tools. A wire brush is a good option for knocking off the majority of rust, especially in those tight spaces, but you’ll find that the 80 grit sandpaper will do a better job. If you have a small electric sander, this process will go a lot faster.  Sharpen - Now’s a good time to have a look and sharpen any tools that need it. You can sharpen your tools with range of tools, but most gardeners find that a flat file (available here or at your local hardware store) will handle all their sharpening needs.  Before you start, a word about safety. Please wear eye protection. The smallest sliver of metal in the eye can be very painful. Also, wear some heavy gloves to prevent those same slivers of metal from your hands and to prevent cuts from your newly sharpened tools.  Garden tool sharpening can be a dangerous operation if you don’t have the tool secured properly, so secure it in a vise if you have one, clamp it to a table or just get someone to sit on it. Just make sure it’s secure before you start sharpening. Every tool blade typically has some sort of edge bevel on it, so try to file it at the same angle that is already there. Too much (steep) angle will indeed make your tool very sharp, but because the leading edge is so thin, it will be subject to damage by the smallest of stones, so try to stick with the angle that is there.  Oil - Let’s start by saying, do not use any petroleum based oil on your garden tools...you’ll just end up transferring that oil on your tools to the soil in your garden. Here at Garden Tool Co., we only use Boiled Linseed Oil. It’s a natural product from the seeds of the flax plant (except for the solvent used to keep it from hardening in the can…it evaporates after application) and can be used on the metal and wood parts of your tools. Just apply it liberally all over you tool, let it sit for about 15 minutes and then wipe off excess. Gardeners that live in drier climates should oil their handles more often to prevent your handles from drying out and cracking.  Rust on any of your tools is the result of oxygen and water reacting with the metal, so the purpose of the oil is to create a barrier between the metal and oxygen/water.  That’s it, protect your investment in garden tools and they will last a very long time. "
3,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/choosing-a-garden-fork,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Choosing a Garden Fork," Choosing a garden fork...easy right? I mean, all you have to look for is a garden fork that is well made by a reputable company and you’re done. Well...maybe not. What kind of work are you asking your garden fork to do?  While at first glance, many garden forks look the same, but take a little closer look and you’ll see the differences. So, what types of “garden forks” are there? Let’s see, there are, Digging, Spading, Garden (English), Border, Compost, Potato, Broadfork and many more specialty forks.  OK...now that we’re really confused with so many types, let’s take a look at what type of work each fork is made to do and hopefully this helps you land the perfect garden fork.  Digging Fork - The digging fork typically has strong thinner square tines and is great for turning undisturbed soil for a new garden or bed. They can also be used for many of the same chores as a garden fork.  Garden Fork - The most popular garden fork has four flat tines with a flat facing the front of the fork for lifting. With their flat-faced tines, these forks are good for digging in loamy, sandy or loose soil, aerating, mixing in nutrients, turning your soil in the spring and harvesting potatoes and other root vegetables.  Border Fork - The border fork is usually just a smaller head size version of the garden fork and is becoming very popular.  Compost Fork - The compost fork has long thin tines and is made for lifting light weight materials such as compost (not made for digging).  Broad Fork - This monster fork had two long handles attached to a wide fork with many tines. It is used to turn undisturbed soil for a new garden. If you’ve got a lot of soil to turn, this is the beast to do it.  Potato Fork - The potato fork has a wide head with tines spaced close together. The tines usually have blunt ends so as not to damage the potatoes during harvest.  As with all garden tools, what might be right for me may not work for you, so pick what works for your type of gardening. The forged tools may cost more initially, but the quality, strength, warranty and the fact that you’ll have a garden tool that you can pass down to the next generation far outweighs the cost. Plus, you’re not tossing a bent garden tool into the landfill every couple of years.  ***Fork Head Size - Most people (including me) automatically choose the largest fork size they can buy. We think that we can get more done with the larger size, but in reality we're only tiring ourselves too sooner...not to mention the back pain involved using a large tool. Many gardeners have found that by using the smaller border size makes for a lot less back pain, less tiresome and more enjoyable gardening. -Just something for you to think about. "
4,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/choosing-a-garden-spade,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Choosing a Garden Spade," We've come a long way since we were digging with our hands way back when to the gardening spade that we use today. Only the quality of the materials have changed since the Chinese had a bronze spade that closely resembled today's spade around 1100 B.C.  Gardening spades are workaholics and because of the nature of the work they do, it's counterproductive to not buy the best one you can afford. Buying look alike garden tools will just frustrate you and adds to our landfills.  With all that said, let's start with the head of the spade. The shape of the spade's leading edge can help you immensely depending on your soil type. A deeply dished blade (usually found on a shovel) will speed up the process of moving loose materials.  Slightly Rounded Leading Edge - This is the most common garden spade and works well in most soils.   Pointed Leading Edge - The point or points help greatly in rocky soils as the points deflect away from smaller rocks. The point also makes it easier to push into any type of soil.   Narrow Blade - The narrow blade spade are great for digging in confined spaces as well as digging ditches.   Slotted Blade - The slotted blade is made to have less friction going into the ground in sticky clay soils.    Let's talk handles. Ash hardwood handles have been the standard for hundreds of years, not only for their durability, but the ability to absorb shock and vibration. Fiberglass handles are stronger, but absorb less shock and are harder to fit into the socket should it break and need to be replaced. Steel handles are very durable, but heavy...some gardeners like the added weight for digging.  Spade handles come in a variety of shapes and lengths with ""T"" handles being the most popular. ""D"" and Bulb End handles are also quit popular, but what it comes down to is personal preference. Also, when choosing the length, remember that spade is a lot shorter when the blade is in the soil. Using a spade that is too short is likely to strain your back and make gardening less enjoyable.   ***Spade Head Size - Most people (including me) automatically choose the largest blade size they can buy. We think that we can get more done with the larger size, but in reality we're only tiring ourselves too sooner...not to mention the back pain involved using a large tool. Many gardeners are opting to use the smaller border size spade. It makes for a lot less back pain, less tiresome and more enjoyable gardening. -Just something for you to think about.   "
5,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/list-of-garden-tools-every-gardener-must-have-or-not,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,List of Garden Tools Every Gardener Must Have...Or Not," While some would tell you that there is some magic list of garden tools that every gardener should have, the simple fact is, gardens and gardeners come in all shapes, sizes and needs.  We are short and tall, right and left handed, large vegetable garden, a small flower bed or our favorite plants on the balcony, but one thing we all have in common is, we want our garden tools to last and to work as hard as we do.  Like us, garden tools also come in all shapes, sizes and ways we can use them. A simple hand hoe that may be perfect for someone weeding a flower bed may also be the favorite tool for a vegetable gardener making furrows for seeds.  Below is not a list of garden tools you should have, but “suggestions” on garden tools that many gardeners might find useful for a particular type or size garden.  Large Vegetable Garden  For sizable gardens, most gardeners find that the longer handled tools not only save the back, but are able to work more area in less time. Buying good quality garden tools will save yourself a lot of broken and bent tool headaches. Look for tried and true materials such as thick carbon or stainless steel tool bodies and Ash tool handles from managed forests.  Garden/Digging Fork -Some would call this tool a gardener's favorite tool, but it is really your soil’s best friend. Great for turning the soil, aeration and mixing nutrients into the soil.  Garden/Digging Spade -Great for digging, turning the soil, soil aeration and its straight blade also makes it a good edging tool.  Garden Hoes -The never ending battle with weeds is best tackled with a hoe or cultivator (not chemicals). There are many, many head shapes available and most gardeners have a favorite, but a few of the favorites are: pull hoes, hoes like the diamond shaped hoe that works on the push and pull strokes, Dutch hoe, scuffle hoe, oscillating hoe (also called a hula hoe, action hoe and stirrup hoe), half-moon hoe and the heart shaped hoe. Many gardeners own several hoes for the different chores such as weeding between plantings, cleaning up between crop rows or even turning the hoe on edge to create seed furrows.  Garden Rake -If you’re making a new garden or adding on to an existing plot, the garden rake is great for leveling and clearing debris from your soil.  Garden Hand Tools -Now that you have the workhorse tools, you may find any number of smaller tools handy when you’re out in the garden. These tools will probably be specific to your type of gardening.  Pruners -Every gardeners go to pruning tool...buy a good pair and you’ll have a lifetime garden tool.  Hori Hori knife- this gardeners favorite is great for light digging, weeding, planting and so many more.  Wheelbarrow or Garden Cart  Remember, you’re unique and the way you garden is too, so choose tools that make your gardening more enjoyable.    Raised Bed Garden  This type of gardening is becoming very popular because of ease of maintenance and the ability to grow a lot in a smaller space. With most raised beds no wider than four feet, it’s easy to reach half way across the bed from both sides making shorter garden tools a good option.  Garden Spade and/or Fork -great tools for turning the soil, aerating, and mixing nutrients into the soil.  Long Handle Hoes - Even with the narrower beds, the longer weeding hoes with their variety of head shapes can be useful.  Medium Length Tools -Look for some medium length tools. There are forks, spades and other mid-length tools out there including good quality kids tools. If you have a favorite long tool that is too long, cut the handle to length that suits your needs.  Dutch Hand Hoe -At 18 inches long, this is a favorite among many gardeners. Available in right and left handed versions, is great for weeding and making furrows for seeds and can easily reach across the bed.  Trowels -With so many different types of trowels available, you may find that a good trowel will handle all your planting needs.  Hori Hori Knife -This is the “MacGyver” of garden tools. Great for digging, weeding, planting, cutting bags open and so many more things.  Pruning Shears or Pruning Knife -Good for harvesting time or cutting unwanted greenery.  As with all gardening, you’re different, and a tool that is popular with others might not work for you, so look around and find the right tool for your gardening chore.    Flower Beds and Lawn  If you are maintaining a yard with flower beds, (and maybe a veggie garden too) you’ll find that your garden tool list seems to be never ending. The good news is that you can use several of your tools not only in your flower beds, but in your veggie garden and yard as well. The garden fork works just as hard in your flower beds as it does in the garden. Your garden spade that you use to turn soil in the garden also works great for planting large shrubs and small trees as well a lawn edger. Those weeding tools you use in the garden will work just fine in your flower beds. Other tools you might find useful are:  Garden Rake -good for leveling and raking debris from your soil.  Leaf Rake -those leaves in the trees are going to fall and the leaf rake is a must for gathering them.  Rabbiting Spade -this spade has a narrow pointed blade that is great for transplanting shrubs, ditch digging or planting one gallon container plants.  Shovels and Specialty spades -You may find that you need sharp pointed shovel for general digging or maybe a border spade for those tight spaces.  Edger -More and more gardeners are choosing to lose more of their lawn and plant beds with native drought tolerant plants to save water and the edger is a great garden tool for defining those beds.  Loppers or Pruning Saw -Loppers are great for pruning smaller tree and bush limbs that are green and the pruning saw for dead branches.  Pruners -Probably the most used tool in the gardeners arsenal. Spend the money to buy a good pair and you’ll have a lifetime tool.  Wheelbarrow or Garden Cart  Water Hose -look around, ask your neighbors to find the best quality water hose you buy...you’ll save yourself a lot of grief.    Townhouse or Apartment Garden  Though you live in a place where you probably don’t have dedicated space to garden, you are just as much a gardener and need tools to tend your container garden. Those tools might include:  Trowel -Its small size make it great for planting in containers.  Soil Scoop -Great for transferring soil from bag to container.  Garden Knife (Hori Hori) -Great all around tool that is handy for opening bags, weeding.  Pruners -Your plants may or may not need some pruning, but if they do, buy a good pair...they’ll last a lifetime.  Watering Can -While any container will do, a watering can with its rosette distributes the water evenly and gentler, especially for those young seedlings.    There are hundreds of shapes and sizes of garden tools to be found, but most found today are but mere gimmicks or cheap copies on an original tried and true designs that old school garden tool companies have been hand making for hundreds of years.These garden tool artisans have been making tools to solve problems in the garden and you can bet that someone through the years has had your problem and made a tool to solve that problem.

6,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/garden-trowels-they-re-all-the-same-right,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Garden Trowels – They’re All The Same…Right?," It wasn’t too long ago that if you went looking for a garden trowel, you could go to 10 different places and buy a trowel at each place and you’d end up 10 almost identical looking trowels. And that was fine; I mean, all we used them for was digging small holes, planting, potting and maybe some occasional weeding.  Well, times have changed and some of the better garden tool makers are making specialty garden trowels. Don’t get me wrong, the traditional garden trowel is and always will be around and there will always be a use for them, but some tool makers have taken a look that the different jobs that a gardener does and adapted the trowel’s shape to fit a particular garden chore.  Good trowel – bad trowel. A good quality trowel should last you a lifetime, but all too often these days the garden tools available today are cheap knockoffs. A good garden trowel should have some weight to it and made of a good quality steel. Another good measure of the tools worth is its warranty. Is the tool maker proud enough of their tools to guarantee it for life?  So, what kind of trowels are there? Here's a list of some of the trowels we offer.   Standard Trowel  Flower Bed Trowel  Transplanting Trowel  Japanese Trowel  Hori Hori Trowel  Rock Garden Trowel  Widger Trowel  Dandelion Trowel  Heart-Shaped Trowel  Planting Trowel  Soil Scoop Trowel  Hoe Trowel  Transplanting Trowel w/ Bottle Opener  Terrarium Trowel  Half-Round Trowel  Archeology Trowel   As you can see, trowels have changed from just the standard shape. We all garden a little differently and a trowel someone might use for planting, another might use it for weeding. We invite you to have a look at the trowels we offer and imagine how a certain shaped trowel might make your gardening more enjoyable.  Like buying other garden tools, it's up to you to decide which trowel will work the best for the way you garden, but if you have a question, please don't hesitate to call us at 1-855-482-8665.

7,https://www.gardentoolcompany.com/pages/quality-garden-tools-are-they-worth-it,Garden Tool Articles – Garden Tool Company,Quality Garden Tools...Are They Worth It?," OK, I'll start this out by saying that I realize that not everyone can afford the higher quality garden tools, nor do I think that people who ""garden"" one Saturday every spring necessarily need a better quality garden tool, but if you're an avid gardener and you rely on your tools to make your gardening more enjoyable and less tiresome, isn't it worth it to have tools that work as hard as you do....time after time?  So let's take a look at what you get in a higher quality, handmade garden tool that you don't get in bargain, off-the-shelf garden tool.    Quality - excellent, superior, strong, fine, high grade - all words that you probably would not use to describe the garden tools you normally find at the big box stores, but all these words describe the value of a quality garden tool.    Design - Most of the tools that we offer are made by companies that have been perfecting the design of the tools for over a hundred years. A little bend here, a little more strength there, all to make the tool more efficient and enjoyable to use...no one-size-fits-all tools.    Materials - At the heart of any garden tool is the metal that it is made of. While most garden tool makers are always looking for cheaper, thinner metals to make their tools, meaning more money in their pockets, better quality tool makers will only use the highest quality metals available and will not skimp for the sake of an extra few pennies per tool. These tool makers also choose only the straightest grained Ash hardwood for the tool handles    Company - The quality of the garden tool is only as good as the character of the company that makes them. Two of companies whose tools we carry are still family owned after a hundred years or more and realize the time and effort needed to make a quality garden tool.    Warranty - A lot of the tools we carry have a lifetime warranty because the companies that make these tools believe in the products they make and stand behind their quality. With a bargain tool, you'll probably be standing at the returns counter for quite a while arguing with a cashier whether the warranty is valid...if it has one at all.    Cheaper? - One might argue that these tools are less expensive in the long run if you break a couple of cheap tools, time and gas to go to the store again, waiting in the returns line, etc.... not to mention the frustration involved.     ""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."" -Warren Buffett    What about where it is made? The Sneeboer tools we offer are handmade in Holland and you'd be hard pressed to find better quality...but at a price. We've all had our experiences with ""Made in China"", but I'm here to tell you that the Chinese can make quality products...it's the companies that specify the design and materials that make for cheap products. For example, we offer Burgon & Ball and Barebones tools. Both made in China and both are of good quality because the companies specify good quality materials that the tools are made of.  So, the best quality garden tools are available, but what's ""best"" for me may not be what's ""best"" for you. "

The advantages of mowing the lawn in a traditional manner are a clean lawn area, less frequent mowing and that the lawn cuttings can be used as a fertiliser for flowers.

That sounds vague, but how short or long the lawn should be mown does indeed depend on a few factors. Cutting it too short damages the lawn and even the grass roots – especially at dry and hot times of the year. The consequence is then brown patches. Or in other words: (Too much) direct sunlight is toxic! If the lawn is too short, it is hit hard by sunlight and loses strength. This can lead to weeds spreading and taking over the lawn little by little. This can in turn also happen if the grass is too long. For the lawn to be at optimal cutting height, lawn mowers can be manually adjusted to various cutting heights. The one-third rule and what is known as the vegetation point are of significance in this context. This can be found at roughly mid-height of a blade of grass. If you mow down more, it takes quite a long time until the sprouts have recovered from this – healthy grass growth is hardly possible, particularly as the increased sunlight also bothers the mown lawn. What does that mean in concrete terms? A lawn should only ever be shortened to a third of the height to which it has currently grown. This means that two thirds remains, which is perfectly in line with the respectively recommended cutting height. Supposing that you go on holiday and the lawn grows 15 centimetres in this time, then you should trim it by only approximately five centimetres, i.e. not shorter than 10–11 centimetres. The expert tip is as follows: For a healthy lawn, it is better to mow a little less per use, to do so regularly and to take into account the weather and the condition of the blades of grass. A trick for an even lawn cutting height is not to enter the unmown lawn areas, as otherwise the blades of grass fold over and do not stand up again immediately."

Do you use a classic lawn mower with a collection basket, a lawn mower for mulching or a 2-in-1 solution with a mulching kit (with Kärcher, included in the scope of supply)? Or rather a trimmer – and if yes, should this be battery-powered or not? Moreover, there are robotic lawn mowers that take over mowing work completely, while you can sit back in your garden lounger. The old lawn mower with a power cord may still be in the arbour, but mowing the lawn with it isn't really much fun – too bulky, too heavy and too little power! Many questions and options that can quickly confuse you. The selection of a device depends on a few quality features in addition to the profile of requirements for your own garden and personal taste. First and foremost, the new device for mowing the lawn should work reliably. If you decide on battery-powered devices, you should be able to work with the battery for as long as possible. So what is known as the area performance (m² per battery charge for lawn mowers; m per battery charge forlawn trimmersas well asgrass & shrub shears) specifies the runtime of the device. The area performance can vary depending on the quality and profile of the lawn. You should also have the cutting width and height at the back of your mind. Especially when it comes to the cutting height, it depends on what the conditions in the garden are like. Is the lawn flat or are there undulations?"
1,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/mowing-the-lawn.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,The classic for mowing the lawn: The lawn mower,"You essentially have the choice between lawn mowers with a cord, as a petrol-powered model or with a battery. Which is better? Modern battery lawn mowers are in no way inferior to petrol-powered lawn mowers. On the contrary! With regard to volume, setup time and maintenance, more and more amateur gardeners are choosing battery-powered lawn mowers. The fact that these have the advantage over older lawn mower generations with power cords can be quickly explained as follows. They are both lighter and quieter – and are not a tripping hazard due to their lack of cord. When it comes to the issue of handling, in particular, you should consider precisely which properties you do not want to do without. Should the lawn mower be as light as possible, so that it is easy to push and easy to stow? Should it also be foldable, as well as having a handle for carrying and for convenient cutting height adjustment? Compact18-volt lawn mowerswith cutting widths of up to 36 centimetres are suitable for small lawn areas. If larger areas of lawn need to be mown,36-volt deviceswith cutting widths of up to 46 centimetres can be of advantage in order to save time."

Equipped with a quickly rotating plastic trimmer line or plastic blade, it reliably trims grass and weeds. Due to their battery operation, trimmers are very quiet, and the operating noise can be reduced even further through the use of plastic blades. When it comes to handling, a shoulder strap included in the scope of supply as well as rotatable trimmer knobs and height-adjustable handles make work considerably easier. As the trimmer lines rotate at high speed and parts of the lawn or pebble stones could skid around where possible, it is essential for you to wear safety goggles and strong footwear. Likewise, you should keep a distance from trees and ornamental plants as well as wooden patios in order to avoid damage. Very practical: You can obtain trimmer lines available by the metre in a DIY store if they become worn, and wind into the trimmer line spool quite easily by yourself in this way."

Robotic lawn mowers are on trend.,"In recent years,robotic lawn mowershave become more and more popular. The motto is clear: The robot does the work, you sit back and enjoy a break. But what does automatic lawn maintenance depend on? Depending on how large your own lawn area is, it may be worth looking at the precise size and battery runtime of the respective model. If the garden is rather narrow and winding, the ideal selection is a small robotic lawn mower. When it comes to cutting work, a distinction is made between rotary mowers and sickle bar mowers. The latter have larger blades, and are therefore suitable for thick grass, on which fallen fruit or limbs may sometimes lie. The principle can be quickly explained. There is a charging station from which the robotic lawn mower starts (and where it is automatically charged). Most models mow at random. It's true that there are also devices that mow along set paths, but sometimes that works well and other times it works less well. One way or another, the grass is mown after a few days – without any effort on your part."

This can lead to weeds spreading and taking over the lawn little by little. This can in turn also happen if the grass is too long. For the lawn to be at optimal cutting height, lawn mowers can be manually adjusted to various cutting heights. The one-third rule and what is known as the vegetation point are of significance in this context. This can be found at roughly mid-height of a blade of grass. If you mow down more, it takes quite a long time until the sprouts have recovered from this – healthy grass growth is hardly possible, particularly as the increased sunlight also bothers the mown lawn. What does that mean in concrete terms? A lawn should only ever be shortened to a third of the height to which it has currently grown. This means that two thirds remains, which is perfectly in line with the respectively recommended cutting height. Supposing that you go on holiday and the lawn grows 15 centimetres in this time, then you should trim it by only approximately five centimetres, i.e. not shorter than 10–11 centimetres. The expert tip is as follows: For a healthy lawn, it is better to mow a little less per use, to do so regularly and to take into account the weather and the condition of the blades of grass. A trick for an even lawn cutting height is not to enter the unmown lawn areas, as otherwise the blades of grass fold over and do not stand up again immediately."

Mowing the lawn depending on requirements","Many amateur gardeners ask themselves whichgarden toolwill make the lawn perfect. Do you use a classic lawn mower with a collection basket, a lawn mower for mulching or a 2-in-1 solution with a mulching kit (with Kärcher, included in the scope of supply)? Or rather a trimmer – and if yes, should this be battery-powered or not? Moreover, there are robotic lawn mowers that take over mowing work completely, while you can sit back in your garden lounger. The old lawn mower with a power cord may still be in the arbour, but mowing the lawn with it isn't really much fun – too bulky, too heavy and too little power! Many questions and options that can quickly confuse you. The selection of a device depends on a few quality features in addition to the profile of requirements for your own garden and personal taste. First and foremost, the new device for mowing the lawn should work reliably. If you decide on battery-powered devices, you should be able to work with the battery for as long as possible. So what is known as the area performance (m² per battery charge for lawn mowers; m per battery charge forlawn trimmersas well asgrass & shrub shears) specifies the runtime of the device. The area performance can vary depending on the quality and profile of the lawn. You should also have the cutting width and height at the back of your mind. Especially when it comes to the cutting height, it depends on what the conditions in the garden are like. Is the lawn flat or are there undulations?"

Which is better? Modern battery lawn mowers are in no way inferior to petrol-powered lawn mowers. On the contrary! With regard to volume, setup time and maintenance, more and more amateur gardeners are choosing battery-powered lawn mowers. The fact that these have the advantage over older lawn mower generations with power cords can be quickly explained as follows. They are both lighter and quieter – and are not a tripping hazard due to their lack of cord. When it comes to the issue of handling, in particular, you should consider precisely which properties you do not want to do without. Should the lawn mower be as light as possible, so that it is easy to push and easy to stow? Should it also be foldable, as well as having a handle for carrying and for convenient cutting height adjustment? Compact18-volt lawn mowerswith cutting widths of up to 36 centimetres are suitable for small lawn areas. If larger areas of lawn need to be mown,36-volt deviceswith cutting widths of up to 46 centimetres can be of advantage in order to save time."

A battery lawn trimmer helps.,"The secret to perfect lawn edges: For inaccessible areas of the lawn, you can't get around with abattery lawn trimmer. Equipped with a quickly rotating plastic trimmer line or plastic blade, it reliably trims grass and weeds. Due to their battery operation, trimmers are very quiet, and the operating noise can be reduced even further through the use of plastic blades. When it comes to handling, a shoulder strap included in the scope of supply as well as rotatable trimmer knobs and height-adjustable handles make work considerably easier. As the trimmer lines rotate at high speed and parts of the lawn or pebble stones could skid around where possible, it is essential for you to wear safety goggles and strong footwear. Likewise, you should keep a distance from trees and ornamental plants as well as wooden patios in order to avoid damage. Very practical: You can obtain trimmer lines available by the metre in a DIY store if they become worn, and wind into the trimmer line spool quite easily by yourself in this way."

Robotic lawn mowers are on trend.,"In recent years,robotic lawn mowershave become more and more popular. The motto is clear: The robot does the work, you sit back and enjoy a break. But what does automatic lawn maintenance depend on? Depending on how large your own lawn area is, it may be worth looking at the precise size and battery runtime of the respective model. If the garden is rather narrow and winding, the ideal selection is a small robotic lawn mower. When it comes to cutting work, a distinction is made between rotary mowers and sickle bar mowers. The latter have larger blades, and are therefore suitable for thick grass, on which fallen fruit or limbs may sometimes lie. The principle can be quickly explained. There is a charging station from which the robotic lawn mower starts (and where it is automatically charged). Most models mow at random. It's true that there are also devices that mow along set paths, but sometimes that works well and other times it works less well. One way or another, the grass is mown after a few days – without any effort on your part."

6,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/cutting-hedges.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,It all comes down to the technology! A straight hedge with a cord.,"If you ask a gardening expert how hedge cutting can succeed perfectly and above all how to make it straight, the answer is always: It doesn't work without a cord! It is astonishingly easy. You pull the cord sideways along the upper area of the hedge. The guidance line should be secured not to the hedge but, for instance, to two posts or poles. It should be at the height at which you want the top of the hedge to be after cutting. The guidance line should also be taut, so that it is not bent by limbs protruding into its path, and the desired shape of the hedge isn't spoiled by unsightly bumps."
6,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/cutting-hedges.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,1. Pulling the cord,"A guidance line is pulled taut sideways where you want the top of the hedge to be later. It acts as a guide for cutting straight. Before you begin, you should also always check the hedge for birds' nests one more time."
6,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/cutting-hedges.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,2. Vertical cutting,"Now the hedge is cut from the bottom to the top with even movements. Taking a step back every now and then is recommended in order to see whether you are still cutting in alignment. Attention: Deciduous trees with larger leaves should preferably be cut manually, as the leaves could potentially be damaged and die off through the use of an electrical hedge trimmer. So the motto is as follows: Less is more! Only cut away as much as necessary and so that green foliage can still be seen."

Horizontal cutting,"Trimming the canopy requires especially great concentration. The cutting tool should be positioned just above the stretched guidance line. Especially when using a ladder construction, this work step should be carried out in a careful and focused manner. Professional tip: Apole hedge trimmerwith an adjustable cutting head cuts precise contours without you having to strain yourself in doing so."

Details,"As soon as the main area of the hedge has been cut, you can focus on the details with a hedge trimmer and give the hedge the finishing touches. Then servicing and maintenance of garden tools are due."
6,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/cutting-hedges.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,5. Maintenance,"Ideally, you should check every device immediately after use for damage and dirt. Should earth and plant residues still stick to the device, these can be removed with a damp sponge and a hard brush. It should be regularly checked that all nuts, screws and bolts on the device are seated firmly. Regularly sharpening the cutting blades of the hedge trimmer with a flat file is recommended in order to maintain a consistently good cutting performance. Then removing the ridge resulting from grinding with a sharpening stone is also recommended. Anyone who doesn't dare to grind the cutting blades themselves can have the hedge trimmer sharpened by a specialist. Last but not least, the blade should be polished with a suitable oil (e.g. Ballistol oil) in order to protect it against rust."

Hedge cutting disposal,"First work then pleasure – before your own work can be admired, trimmed branches and leaves must of course still be disposed of. Anyone who owns a chopper can optimally chop the cutting material and thus prepare it for the organic waste bin or the compost heap, or for further transport to a recycling centre. Alimb cutteris also appropriate for thick limbs."

In certain areas around the house, there is an obligation to remove leaves in many regions, similar to the obligation to clear snow and ice. Owners of plots of ground adjacent to pavements must remove the leaves, and can also pass on this obligation to their tenants. You should clear the leaves often enough to ensure that passers-by cannot slip. It is sensible to clear leaves from drives in autumn for the same reason, so that braking distances are not affected. In contrast, you don't necessarily have to clear leaves in the garden under trees and hedges. Here you can wait until spring in order to offer protection for smaller animals such as hedgehogs and insects. In addition, the leaves can act as frost protection and natural fertiliser for garden plants. The leaves should, however, not be placed thickly enough on beds that no more air gets to the ground. Anyone who fears that autumn storms will blow away the leaves can additionally cover them with branches, for example with softwoods. In spring, you can then remove the cover and the leaves from March/April. The exceptions in a garden are lawn areas. Anyone who values a well-maintained lawn should remove the leaves, because otherwise yellow spots will form where the grass is not getting any sunlight. Theoretically you can do this with a lawn mower – depending on the thickness of the leaf layer. But clearing leaves with a lawn mower is not especially animal-friendly. A rake is more suitable, or, if you want to save energy, aleaf blower or blower vac."

Anyone who wants to remove leaves from pavements, drives and on the lawn faster and more easily should switch to a leaf blower. The strong air flow of the device manages to sweep leaves almost by itself, and also helps to remove leaves in difficult-to-access places and on flowerbeds or bark mulch. With the Kärcherbattery leaf blowers, leaves can be swept in a targeted manner onto a heap. An additional scraper edge also loosens wet leaves or compacted dirt. TheLBL 4 leaf blower has two speed levels. Leaves can hereby be carefully removed from gravel, and you can get started on the pavement and lawn with greater power. Thanks to the removable blow tube, Kärcher leaf blowers can be stowed so that they save space."

But in the meantime, the autumn wind gets into the heaps of leaves and scatters the leaves again. Ideally, therefore, you should do both in one operation, i.e. sweep and collect leaves with one device, asweeper. Sweepers are especially suitable for paved areas such as pavements, drives or streets, and remove leaves and dirt without bending over thanks to the height-adjustable push handle and simply by moving the device. The waste container offers lots of space and can be emptied in just a few steps. Depending on the model,one or two side brushes can be installed with no tools required. This allows edges, crevices and corners to be cleaned too. With theS 4 Twin 2-in-1manual sweeper, even wet leaves are no problem. The side brushes are fitted with harder bristles and so sweep without difficulty even in damp areas. Sweepers are used the whole year round – sweeping leaves, removing grit from the winter, sweeping pollen and blossoms together. And after the work's been done?

Here too, you should regularly remove dirt and leaves, so that rain water drains in the desired manner and so that water damage can be avoided. If dirt has settled in the first place, removing it is a time-consuming and laborious matter. In many cases, the work is done on a ladder that frequently has to be moved in order to reach across the full length of the gutter. Roof gutters and downpipes can be effortlessly cleaned with Kärcher'sRoof Gutter and Pipe Cleaning Kit, suitable for Kärcherhigh-pressure cleaners. The roof gutter cleaning nozzle of the set is moved on a carriage through the roof gutter almost by itself, thanks to high pressure from the cleaning device. Two high-pressure nozzles are attached to the underside of the cleaning carriage so that the water streams backwards. The recoil effect drives the carriage forwards, lifts off the dirt and rinses it backwards. With a hose length of 20 metres, you can get far without having to stand on the ladder in the direct vicinity. After brief retrofitting, downpipes and waste water pipes can also be relieved of blockages with this accessory. The high-pressure hose without the carriage is used here. A special pipe cleaning nozzle is used instead, which uses the recoil of the water stream directed backwards to penetrate into the blockage from leaves and other dirt, and rinses the downpipe clear again. Tip: The hose of the pipe cleaning kit has a red safety marking. The hose should always be guided into the pipe at least up to this marking and the cleaning process stopped as soon as the marking can be seen again when pulling the hose out. This way, you are protected from water spraying backwards, as well as from potential dangers due to a high-pressure hose spinning around."

You can dispose of smaller quantities of leaves and green waste in your organic waste bin, but they fill up quickly in autumn on plots of ground with many trees. In some regions, municipalities offer special sacks or baskets that are placed on the roadside when full and then disposed of. Otherwise, you need to make the journey to the garden cuttings collection point of the nearest recycling centre. Sweeping leaves for the autumn bonfire? Burning leaves and garden cuttings is prohibited in many municipalities or greatly restricted in terms of the time of year. Justifiably, as even withered leaves still contain enough water that smoke and unwelcome odours can develop when they are burned. Fine dust can likewise be released. So remove leaves in the household waste? Just not in rubbish bins and recycling bins – these may not be emptied if they are filled incorrectly. So – leaf bag, recycling centre or compost. Anyone who has enough space in their garden can also create a pile of leaves as a winter home for hedgehogs, etc."

There is also the possibility of creating a compost heap with lawn cuttings and leaves. Micro-organisms and worms then convert this over the course of time into humus, which is rich in nutrients. However, you must be aware that a successful compost heap depends on the mixture. Not all types of trees are suitable, and many leaves have a very low nutritional content. The site of the compost heap should be half-shaded, and it must be on open – i.e. not sealed off – ground. If you bear this information in mind when making your garden winter-proof, you can be glad of fresh humus at the start of the spring."

But storage in heated spaces is not always an option. In the event of heavy frost, the temperatures in the garden shed or in the garage may also fall below freezing point. Then there is the risk that small quantities of residual water in the high-pressure cleaner will freeze. Because water expands when frozen, seals and, in the worst-case scenario, pump engineering can be destroyed. In order to prevent frost damage, it is advisable to discharge any existing residual water from the device, the accessories and the hoses. Our recommendation: Dismantle the accessory and switch on the high-pressure cleaner without a water connection for approximately half a minute until it has run totally dry. If the device is equipped with a detergent tank, this should also be emptied and rinsed out before storage. In order to remove residual amounts of cleaning chemicals from the system, the tank can simply be filled with approx. 0.2 litres of fresh water. Then switch on the device briefly in cleaning mode. The water is now conveyed from the tank. Once a year, you should also check and clean the water filter at the high-pressure cleaner supply. You can perform these tasks at the same time."

Otherwise the electronics could be damaged. The same applies to battery storage in the winter and to the charging station. The end of October at the latest is the time for bringing devices into a dry space – so ideally once the lawn has been mown for the last time that year. In order to put the battery lawn mower or robotic lawn mower away for the winter, the battery should be charged to around 75 per cent. Background: Completely discharging lithium-ion batteries reduces their lifetime. Ideally, batteries are stored at temperatures between 10 and 20 °C. So you should ideally store them in the house over the winter, while the robotic lawn mower or the battery lawn mower itself can be stored in a shed, basement or garage without any problems. If the battery is permanently installed in the robotic lawn mower, the device should be stored in a dry place over the winter. Exactly the same also applies to robotic lawn mowers as to the storage of small devices for the garden. They should be cleaned – neither with a hose nor with a high-pressure cleaner, but rather ideally with a damp cloth. Otherwise the electronics in the device could suffer. In order to dismantle the charging station, all cords must first be removed and the ends of the cords protected against moisture and frost with a film. If the contacts of the charging station are soiled, they should be cleaned with fine-grained sandpaper."

A rake is the best choice for this. Finally, the lawn should be fertilised for one last time that year – this provides it with important nutrients over the winter."

Some plants such as lavender, Christmas rose, scarlet fuchsia and horned violet are hardy and can remain in the garden during the winter. But not just anywhere – rather in a place in which they are protected against weathering. Any potted plants that need to spend the winter in the house must first be checked for diseases and pests. If they are diseased or infested, there is the risk that the disease or the vermin will spread to other plants – especially if these are standing close together."

There is also the possibility of creating a compost heap with lawn cuttings and leaves. Micro-organisms and worms then convert this over the course of time into humus, which is rich in nutrients. However, you must be aware that a successful compost heap depends on the mixture. Not all types of trees are suitable, and many leaves have a very low nutritional content. The site of the compost heap should be half-shaded, and it must be on open – i.e. not sealed off – ground. If you bear this information in mind when making your garden winter-proof, you can be glad of fresh humus at the start of the spring."

High-pressure cleaners and other devices with a water inlet should be emptied of water before storage. It is important to note that a little water always remains in these devices, which is why devices that carry water must be stored so they are protected against frost. The hoses should also be completely emptied, dried off and then rolled up, without causing any kinks."

10,https://www.kaercher.com/int/home-garden/know-how/making-the-garden-winter-proof.html,Garden maintenance: The best tips and tricks | Kärcher International,Instructions: Storing high-pressure cleaners so as to be frost-proof,"A high-pressure cleaner should always be protected from frost in the winter. But storage in heated spaces is not always an option. In the event of heavy frost, the temperatures in the garden shed or in the garage may also fall below freezing point. Then there is the risk that small quantities of residual water in the high-pressure cleaner will freeze. Because water expands when frozen, seals and, in the worst-case scenario, pump engineering can be destroyed. In order to prevent frost damage, it is advisable to discharge any existing residual water from the device, the accessories and the hoses. Our recommendation: Dismantle the accessory and switch on the high-pressure cleaner without a water connection for approximately half a minute until it has run totally dry. If the device is equipped with a detergent tank, this should also be emptied and rinsed out before storage. In order to remove residual amounts of cleaning chemicals from the system, the tank can simply be filled with approx. 0.2 litres of fresh water. Then switch on the device briefly in cleaning mode. The water is now conveyed from the tank. Once a year, you should also check and clean the water filter at the high-pressure cleaner supply. You can perform these tasks at the same time."

Otherwise the electronics could be damaged. The same applies to battery storage in the winter and to the charging station. The end of October at the latest is the time for bringing devices into a dry space – so ideally once the lawn has been mown for the last time that year. In order to put the battery lawn mower or robotic lawn mower away for the winter, the battery should be charged to around 75 per cent. Background: Completely discharging lithium-ion batteries reduces their lifetime. Ideally, batteries are stored at temperatures between 10 and 20 °C. So you should ideally store them in the house over the winter, while the robotic lawn mower or the battery lawn mower itself can be stored in a shed, basement or garage without any problems. If the battery is permanently installed in the robotic lawn mower, the device should be stored in a dry place over the winter. Exactly the same also applies to robotic lawn mowers as to the storage of small devices for the garden. They should be cleaned – neither with a hose nor with a high-pressure cleaner, but rather ideally with a damp cloth. Otherwise the electronics in the device could suffer. In order to dismantle the charging station, all cords must first be removed and the ends of the cords protected against moisture and frost with a film. If the contacts of the charging station are soiled, they should be cleaned with fine-grained sandpaper."

Moreover, this method saves water and conserves more resources than blasting the garden with tap water by hand. You can water your garden especially effectively using individually adjustable sprinklers and water timers or watering clocks. This allows lawns, plants and bushes to be watered either manually or in a targeted manner according to an individually adjustable watering schedule – even whilst you are at work or on holiday. Another advantage is that automatic watering with, for instance, rain water or ground water does not consume valuable drinking water. Rain water can be collected via a cistern or a water butt and is then connected to the automatic watering system using abooster pumpand ahose system. Of course it also works the same way with ground water or water from wells, which can be distributed effectively in the garden with a garden pump."

This is not only to do with you wanting to learn how automatic watering works and what systems there are. It is also related to the quality and size of your own garden area. For example, there are questions relating to what kind of hose system is suitable and which water source you want to use, in order to provide flowerbeds, hedges and lawns with water in a targeted manner. There are also various types ofwater timers. It is important to know the following here: If you have answered these fundamental questions for yourself, the majority of the ""work"" has been done. Installation of the watering system is uncomplicated and takes just a few minutes."

The most obvious option for this is to use tap water by connecting the garden hose or the watering system to the house's tap. For some garden owners, it may, however, be worth using an alternative water source. A watering system with ground water or water from a well or automatic watering of the garden with rain water is worth considering for this. Anyone who owns a large garden can additionally consider building a well in order to use the collected ground water or rain water to water the garden. It's true that this entails some one-off costs, but it will yield a profit from as early as a few years' time. Collecting rain water in cisterns and collection tanks and dispensing this into the watering system and eventually in the garden usingbooster pumpsis also appropriate for this purpose."

In autumn, you should make the pond winter-proof. This is because leaves that have fallen down, dead plant residues or dead insects form an organic mass at the bottom of the pond, the decomposition of which involves a lot of oxygen being bound. Under a closed-off covering of ice and if water circulation is too low, this then leads to a lack of oxygen for larger animals such as fish and frogs. That's why it's important to clean the garden pond thoroughly before the winter, remove mud and ensure a healthy ecosystem. After the winter, leaves and plant residues have accumulated again in the pond, and a thick mud layer on the ground. These should therefore be removed once more in spring, the pond water should be drained, the bottom of the pond cleaned and new water poured in. The body of water is thus ideally prepared for the summer months."

This is done fastest with asubmersible dirty water pump. It is positioned at the deepest point of the garden pond where the most dirt accumulates. Once the pond is empty, the loose mud is picked up first. The liner, gravel and larger stones can then be cleaned using ahigh-pressure cleaner, so that stuck dirt is released. Work should be done with a flat water stream so as not to damage the pond liner. Particular care should be taken when cleaning the edges of the pond, as a lot of dirt settles here. You can then simply pump the (newly created) dirty water out of the pond with the submersible pump. Then the clean liner is examined for cracks and leaks and repaired if necessary, for example with residues of the pond liner and waterproof PVC adhesive. If everything is OK, the plants return to their place and the pond basin is filled up with fresh water. Particular care must be taken when cleaning the pond if fish are living in it. They must be carefully relocated before cleaning. Storage tanks act as a temporary home. In order to create approximately the same living conditions for the fish, the containers should consequently be filled so that approximately one third of the water in each container is the pond's own water. Pond plants are also protected from drying out in this way. In order to offer them additional protection, do not pour the fresh water into the pond too quickly after cleaning.

An essential factor for the formation of algae is the nutrient content in the pond. This can be determined through a simple pH test. If the pH value is between 6.8 and 8.2, i.e. in the neutral range, it is ideal. If it is above this (alkaline range), the nutrient content is increased. Algae can thus grow in increased numbers. It should therefore be ensured that the pond system is not exposed to too much direct sunlight, as heat encourages algae growth. In addition, pond soil that is as low in nutrients as possible should be used, and various water plants should be used to achieve equilibrium in the body of water. Because algae need nutrients that they bind together inside them for their growth, the nutrients needed for growth are thus withdrawn from the algae if the plants are regularly cut back. The following applies in general: Small ponds require more maintenance than a large pond. A high biomass is created in a narrow space due to a lower water depth and less water. Flat bodies of water also heat up faster in the summer. Higher water temperatures in turn lead to a higher nutrient content, poorer water values and greater algae growth. By implication, this means that the larger the pond, the lower the maintenance effort."

By “living” soil, we mean soil alive with micro and macro organisms like earthworms, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. The good news is that you don’t need to worry about the details, just follow these simple steps and the organisms will thrive:  Keep the soil covered with plants and/or mulch to avoid the direct, baking sun Maintain adequate moisture levels Top-dress bed regularly with 1-2 inches of compost "
2,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Watering,"Watering  Plants cannot survive without water but too much water can also be an issue.  For a new garden, daily watering (if it doesn’t rain) is necessary until the seeds have sprouted and the new plants are established. Once the plants are established, water less frequently but deeply. In the summer heat, even established plants may require water every 2 or 3 days. Feel the soil – don’t assume. Different beds may require different watering durations and frequency. This can be due to foliage covering a majority of the soil in the bed, mulch, organic content of the soil, etc. If you have the time, split watering into two times maybe 1 hour apart. The first watering begins to soak in then the 2 nd watering is absorbed like a sponge. Watering in the morning is best and if possible, avoid letting the water contact the plant leaves. Tomatoes like roughly the same amount of water at regular intervals – see “blossom end rot” and “cracking” under the pest and disease section below for signs of uneven watering. "
3,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Thinning,"Thinning  Thinning is typically only needed only for seeds after they have germinated and are about 2 inches tall. For example, if two radish seeds sprout next to each other, you should thin (clip) one of them so the other can thrive. Refer to the provided seed planting guide but if you’re unsure of the spacing, visualize the size of the mature plant and thin accordingly.  Why Thin?  Plants need room to grow and overcrowding can reduce the amount of output. If there is less contention for nutrients you will get larger plants that produce more. Airflow and sunlight is improved reducing fungal diseases.  How to Thin?  The amount of space needed varies by plant – look at thinning instructions on your seed packages or the seed planting guide GCP provided. If those sources aren’t available, there’s plenty of information online. It’s best to use scissors or clippers to snip the stem just above the soil line. Pulling the plant may damage the roots of the plant you want to keep. If you have a choice, remove the smaller weaker plants. The trimmings of some plants are edible – basically if you eat the greens of the plant, the trimmings are edible. For example, radishes, kale, collards, swiss chard. If you’re in doubt look it up or consult an expert.  Radishes and carrots – 2-3 inches Beets – 4 inches Bush beans – 6 inches Broccoli, cabbage, collards, Swiss chard – 12 inches "

Types of mulch include pine straw, leaves, compost, and wood mulch. Leaves can mat or pack down so they work best after they’ve been shredded. A mulching mower works well. If shredding isn’t feasible, compost them slightly before applying them to the garden. "
5,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Fertilizing,"Fertilizing  When to fertilize and what to fertilize with is tricky due to several factors:  Plants need a variety of nutrients and need them at different stages of growth. How nutrients are made available to plants depends on a variety of factors like soil pH, moisture levels, and the balance between nutrients in the soil – too much of one mineral can block the absorption of another mineral. Different plants have different requirements – for example, tomatoes and winter greens are heavy feeders.  All of this boils down to the fact that there’s not a single recommendation that fits all environments and conditions. In general, a good quality, slow release, organic fertilizer applied during the growing season is helpful for the plants and the soil, but too much is not only wasteful but it can run-off and cause environmental problems in rivers and creeks. Synthetic, water soluble fertilizers are more susceptible to run off and do very little to improve soil health.  Following is a recipe for mixing an organic fertilizer with readily available materials from most garden centers:  1 T fish emulsion (there are alternative nitrogen sources if you prefer to use only vegan material) 1 T seaweed extract 1 T molasses 1 Gal water  Stir the ingredients together and water in with a watering can or apply as a foliar feed with a sprayer. This can cover a typical 4 foot by 12 foot GCP garden bed.  Or, you can purchase a good quality slow release fertilizer: Microlife 6-2-4 is a good general purpose product available at most nurseries.  "
6,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Cultivating,"Cultivating  After a few weeks, soil tends to crust over (especially if it’s not covered in mulch). The heavier soil particles tend to move deeper into the soil structure and the finer, lighter ones move up to fill in the gaps. This process creates a panning effect and water tends to absorb slowly or often just runs off without penetrating deeply into the root structure. Cultivating breaks up the panning soil and allows water and nutrients to penetrate deeper. Cultivating also helps with weed control as it loosens the soil making it easier to remove weeds.  Both a 3 pronged hand rake or a traditional hoe work well – just scratch the soil surface and minimize any disturbance to root zones. "
7,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Weeding,"Weeding  Weeds should be removed because they contend for the same nutrients, water and air flow as your vegetables and they can shelter insects and disease. Make it part of your daily routine to remove weeds since they will be much easier to control when they are young and less established.  Over time, you’ll learn to recognize the weeds and distinguish them from intentional plants. Weeds tend to grow where the ground is bare so mulching is a good tool for weed prevention.  In an organic vegetable garden, do not use herbicides to control weeds in or around your garden. "
8,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Pest and Disease Control,"Pest and Disease Control  Healthy soil, planting the right varieties for the season, adequate water, and sufficient nutrients result in healthy plants less susceptible to pests. A balance of good and bad insects is also important so it’s best to identify a problem, determine if it’s serious enough to take action, and if so, start with the least toxic solution first.  For example, first correct any cultural issues, like removing weeds or removing damaged fruits and leaves. Next, consider handpicking insects like caterpillars on the underside of the leaves of green, leafy vegetables, or use a hard stream of water to remove aphids from the underside of leaves. Also, consider removing out-of-season crops. For example, cool season vegetables like kale and broccoli can attract harlequin beetles as temperatures rise in late spring.  There are numerous local and online resources for pest control – if in doubt, consult an expert:  Green Corn Project – greencornproject@usa.net Travis County Agri-life – https://www.traviscountytx.gov/health-human-services/individuals-families/agrilife-extension Any of the many local Austin nurseries  Note that for any suggested products below or other products suggested by a local nursery, read the label and follow the manufacturer’s directions. GCP only recommends organic approved products (for example, OMRI listed) but even so, organic insecticides are still insecticides and should be used with caution. "
9,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Fire ants,"Fire ants  Fire ants not only make gardening unpleasant (to say the least) but they can also be destructive to plants. You’ll never eradicate them completely but you can keep them at reduced levels and away from garden areas. There are 3 good, organic controls:  Orange oil – mix 2 ounces of orange oil concentrate with a gallon of water and drench the mound. Boiling water – bring a pot of water to a boil or near boil and drench the mound. Fertilome make a bait – Come and Get It – that’s effective in dry conditions.  These methods will usually need to be repeated and can be used in succession a few days apart. Note that orange oil breaks down the waxy coating on plant leaves and thus acts as an herbicide. Therefore it should not be applied directly in a planted garden bed. Boiling water can also damage existing plants. "
10,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Caterpillars,"Caterpillars  Cabbage looper worms and army worms are common on many fall, green leafy vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, collards, and Brussels sprouts. If you have either of these pests, you’ll first notice holes in the leaves. There are natural predators for worms – e.g. trichogramma wasps – so a few holes and a few caterpillars are acceptable. If the population gets out of balance they can do extensive damage to your greens. The first step can be to pick them off and drop them in a glass of soapy water or feed them to your chickens. If they’re still out of balance, a commercial product with the active ingredient bacillus thuringiensis (BT) is effective. "
11,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Leaf-footed bugs and stink bugs,Leaf-footed bugs and stink bugs  You may find these on your tomatoes late in the season. They’re fairly large bugs – .5 inches – and can be green or brown. They’re both sucking insects so you may first notice blotches on your vegetables. The bugs can be hand picked and dropped in a glass of soapy water or sprayed with a commercial insecticidal soap. Note that spraying the plant with water tends to drive the bugs to the top of the plant making picking or spraying easier. 
12,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Aphids,"Aphids  Aphids suck plant juices and excrete a liquid called “honeydew” which drops on whatever is below them and can cause black sooty mold to grow. Many predator bugs feed on aphids. The most well known are lady bugs, adults and larvae, lacewing larvae, soldier beetles, and syrphid fly larvae. If predator bugs aren’t taking care of the problem fast enough, simply wash aphids off stems and leaves with a water hose.  "
13,https://www.greencornproject.org/gardening-guides/garden-maintenance-guide/,Garden Maintenance Guide – Green Corn Project,Tomato problems,"Black spot areas on the bottom of tomatoes is a condition called blossom-end rot. Blossom-end rot (BER) is caused by either a lack of calcium in the soil or the plant’s inability to draw calcium from the soil due to stress or inconsistent or insufficient watering. Harvest the damaged fruit – they’re still edible as long as the BER didn’t spread above the top half of the fruit. Another sign of inconsistent watering for tomatoes is splitting. This is caused by overwatering once the fruit is fully grown. Various fungal diseases can cause leaves to turn brown. Remove affected branches and prune lower branches to avoid contact with the soil (these diseases are often soil born). Also, when watering, try to avoid splattering the soil onto the lower leaves – mulching around the plants can help with this. When pruning tomatoes that might be diseased, clean or sterilize your pruners between cuts and throw trimmings into your city compost bin or trash since a typical home compost pile won’t kill the pathogen. A hydrogen peroxide solution is a good way to sterilize.  END .page-content   END .post-area"

Some causes of abnormal bathroom behavior in cats can be stressors, such as moving to a new house, new people, new pets or other illnesses. Diabetes, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism and osteoarthritis can also be underlying causes of unusual urinary behavior. Your veterinarian will run some diagnostic tests to understand the cause and to help advise a plan to get back on track."

A positive urine culture is really the only way to know if your cat has an infection. More common is feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), which refers to any of the complex disorders that result in abnormal urination or urinary behavior."

If not treated quickly, this can be fatal. FLUTD may result in the accumulation and even concretion of cells, mucous and crystals in the bladder and urethra. If this were to occur in the urethra, your cat wouldn't be able to void urine, leading to potentially serious problems. A urethra obstruction is a medical emergency and your cat should be seen immediately — even in the middle of the night! Indoor, neutered, male cats are at higher risk for urethral obstructions; it is rare in female cats."

A professional check-up will reveal if there’s a problem and rule out any serious disorder. Preventative cat care is key to maintaining vital health with nutritious food, playtime and grooming. Good digestion, for instance, is important. Consider switching food to help support a healthy immune system, healthy skin and coats, as well as strong teeth and bones, for your cat."

Cats evolved as hunters that consume prey that contains high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and a minimal amount of carbohydrates, and their diet still requires these general proportions today. Cats also require more than a dozen other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids.  Although your cat needs certain amounts of each specific nutrient to be healthy, more is not always better. This is particularly true of vitamins and minerals, so the use of supplements is usually not necessary if you are feeding a balanced and complete diet. Supplements can be harmful to your cat, and they should never be given without a veterinarian’s approval. Cats should have access to clean, fresh water at all times. "

These products differ in water content, protein level, caloric density, palatability, and digestibility.  Dry Food  Dry food contains between six and 10 percent water. Depending on the specific formulation, a mixture of ingredients are combined, extruded, and dried into bite-sized pieces. Ingredients may include:   meat and/or meat byproducts  poultry and/or poultry byproducts  grain and/or grain byproducts  fish meal  fiber sources  milk products  vitamin and mineral supplements    The pieces of dry food are often then coated with flavor enhancers, such as animal fat, to make the food more appetizing.  Dry cat food is relatively inexpensive, and since it does not dry out, it offers owners the convenience of “free choice” feeding. However, dry food may be less palatable to a cat than moist or semi-moist food, and depending on the types and quality of the ingredients, may also be less digestible. If you do use dry food, it is important to store unused portions in a cool, dry location, and not to use the food after its expiration date. Owners often buy large amounts of dry food that can sometimes be stored for months, so checking the expiration date before feeding it to your cat is very important. Storing food for a long period of time decreases the activity and potency of many vitamins and increases the likelihood that fats will become rancid. It’s a good idea to store dry cat food in an airtight container to help prevent nutrient deterioration and maintain flavor.  Semi-Moist Food  Meat and meat byproducts are the primary ingredients of semi-moist food, which contains approximately 35 percent moisture. Other materials, including soybean meal, cereals, grain byproducts, and preservatives are added to make the final product. The cost of semi-moist food is generally mid-range. Semi-moist foods may be more appealing than dry cat food to some cats and can also be fed free choice. After the package is opened, however, the food can dry out, becoming less palatable and/or becoming rancid.  Canned Food  Canned cat food has a moisture content of at least 75 percent, making it a good dietary source of water. It is generally the most expensive type of cat food, but is also highly palatable for most cats. Many different varieties are available, which can be helpful if your cat is a finicky eater. Canned food has the longest shelf life when unopened, but any unused portion of opened canned cat food should be refrigerated to maintain quality and prevent spoilage. Gourmet canned cat foods generally feature meats, such as kidney or liver, and whole meat byproducts as primary ingredients. Some brands, however, may be nutritionally incomplete, and it is important to read the nutrition labels carefully on such specialty cat-food items to ensure that they have a nutritional guarantee. "

Basic minimum nutritional requirements for cats have been established by the Feline Nutrition Expert (FNE) Subcommittee of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) , and manufacturers use these standards in producing cat foods.  Reading the nutrition label on food packaging is the best way to compare cat foods. Pet food manufacturers are required to supply certain nutritional information on the package. Labeling regulations are established by the AAFCO and the United States Food and Drug Administration. All pet foods that carry an AAFCO-approved nutritional guarantee, often referred to as the“AAFCO statement,” are considered to be nutritionally complete and balanced.  A cat’s nutritional requirements change through different stages of life. These stages include kittenhood, adulthood, pregnancy, and lactation. The nutritional claim on the cat food label should state the stage of a cat’s life cycle for which the food is complete and balanced, and that it meets the requirements of the AAFCO. Some cat foods are formulated for all life stages, which can simplify the selection process for owners with multiple cats of different ages.  In choosing a cat food, it is also important to read the ingredients list. As with human foods, the items are listed in order of decreasing proportional weight. Look for foods in which meat, meat byproducts, or seafood are listed among the first few ingredients, as this indicates the food probably contains enough animal-source ingredients to supply essential amino acids and fatty acids.  Once you have determined that a food is complete and balanced, choosing between the types of food may be a matter of what your cat prefers. Some cats like canned food, some like dry food, and some like a combination of the two. Choose the ones that work best for your cat. "

It is generally recommended that cat owners purchase nutritionally balanced commercial foods, unless a veterinarian recommends a home-formulated recipe for medical purposes. In that event, your veterinarian will likely recommend a recipe developed by veterinarians certified in animal nutrition. "

A good rule of thumb is not to let treats exceed 10 to 15 percent of a cat’s daily caloric intake. In addition, some foods should be avoided completely. Although raw meat is an excellent source of many nutrients, it is not recommended as a food or a treat for cats, because it is a potential vehicle for toxoplasmosis and other infectious diseases. Some cats that have consumed canned fish products meant for humans have developed potentially serious neurological disorders . Milk is not generally recommended as a treat for cats, as many cats are lactose-intolerant and can develop gastrointestinal problems if fed dairy products. "
7,https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feeding-your-cat,Feeding Your Cat | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine,Other Considerations,"Cats can be choosy about where they eat. Keep in mind that heavy-traffic areas, noise, the presence of other animals, dirty food containers, or nearby litter boxes can deter a cat from eating. Try to be sensitive to your cat’s eating behavior, and make necessary adjustments.  Maintaining a healthy weight is another important consideration. Cats vary greatly in the amount of food they need to consume to ensure they don’t become over-or underweight. Obesity is the most common nutrition-related problem in cats, and makes cats susceptible to a number of health problems, including arthritis and diabetes . Ask your veterinarian to help you determine the ideal body weight for your cat and follow their suggestions for adjusting your cat’s diet to reach and maintain that weight (Figure 1).  Although many cats are content to eat a single food, some cats may develop finicky eating habits and become very selective about what foods they’ll accept. Feeding your cat two or three different cat foods provides flavor variety, and may prevent your cat from developing an exclusive preference for a single food. A cat that refuses to eat can develop serious medical problems. This is true for sick cats that lack an appetite, for cats on a diet, and for the finicky cat that refuses to eat. A veterinarian should examine any cat that refuses to eat and is losing weight.   Updated July 2017"

Before starting the procedure research and educate yourself on this topic.   Trim the nail tips first, being careful not to nick the pink portion of the nail, which houses the blood vessels and nerves.  If your Labrador has black nails, It can be challenging to see them clearly. In this situation, it is preferable to trim a little portion of the nai, tips only.

Here are some measures you should adopt to keep your Labrador Retriever safe:   Be careful not to litter the area with junk and food wrappers. Labradors have sensitive skin and can quickly suffocate if wrappings or other garbage are eaten along with food leftovers.  Ensure there are no sharp objects around that they could gnaw on, walk on, or lay on.  Ponds and swimming pools in your yard should be fenced. Because labs enjoy being in the water, ensure they are being watched closely if you want to take them to the pool.  Install child-proof latches on cabinets and drawers containing common household chemicals, like bleach.. Because of their intelligence, labs can quickly develop the ability to unlock cabinets.  Be aware that many plants are poisonous to dogs, so do your homework before introducing any plants into your home.  Electrical cables should always be hidden because Labradors are known for their chewing habit.  "

With their beautiful coat,, soft demeanor, and sweet personality, it is hard not to fall in love. Labradors require regular grooming to keep their coats fresh and clean. Finding out what works best for your dog can help you give your Labrador healthy coat and save time and money. A clean Labrador is good for the body and soul of both the dog and the dog owner. "
1,https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-groom-a-labrador-retriever/,How to Groom a Labrador Retriever – American Kennel Club,Taking the First Plunge,"Taking the First Plunge  But before rushing your Lab into a total spa experience, Terri Becker DiMarino, president of the California Professional Pet Groomers Association, recommends preparing your dog for accepting touch.  “Handle your Lab’s body—feet, face, mouth, and ears for several days prior to grooming to accustom the dog to the sensation of touch,” says DiMarino. “If you plan on taking your Lab to a groomer, this training will be a good preparation for a new handling experience in a strange place.”  Once your Lab is comfortable with someone’s touch, establish a regular schedule to groom your dog. When the time arrives, assemble everything you need before beginning.  Here’s a list of grooming essentials:   Wide-tooth metal comb.  Quality canine shampoo.  Thick, absorbent towels.  Canine cool air hairdryer.  Canine bathtub or indoor bathtub or shower.  Canine grooming table or outdoor picnic table.  Canine blunt or sharp scissors.  Canine Dremel.  Canine toothpaste and toothbrush.  Disposable dental wipes.  Veterinary ear cleaning solution.  Flea and tick medication.   To prepare Labs for getting their nails trimmed with a grinder , DiMarino encourages owners to turn it on and off for a few days before using it for the first time. If a dog has never been exposed to a canine hairdryer, prepare him for the experience by plugging it in and letting it run a few times before using it. Offering food treats while the grinder and dryer are running will help the Lab look forward to the new noises.  “This gives the dog time to become accustomed to the different sounds,” says DiMarino.  Preservation breeders handle their puppies from day one. They often start trimming their puppies’ nails, lightly brush their coats, and check their ears a few weeks after birth. The pups receive their first baths before they go to their new homes, if not sooner.  "

Dogs who compete in conformation shows are bathed four to five days before they are shown.  “Labrador Retrievers shed twice a year in handfuls,” says Little. “Combing them every day during heavy shedding and bathing in warm water gets rid of the dead hair and saves it from falling all over your floor.”  Use a quality canine shampoo, rinse with clean, warm water. If your Lab goes for a pool swim, it’s a good idea to bathe the dog to remove the chlorine , which could otherwise dry out the coat. "

Keeping nails short helps maintain healthy well-arched toes.  “When you hear clicking on the floor, it’s time to trim your dog’s nails,” says DiMarino. “If you’d rather not wait that long and want to keep your dog’s feet in healthy condition, rev up the grinder once every three to four weeks.”  Owners and handlers who show their Labs in conformation usually trim their dogs’ feet the day before the competition.  The hair between the toes on the pads needs trimming, too. If not, your dog will slip on slick surfaces when walking. As your Lab ages and isn’t as steady as in younger years, this job plus nail trimming becomes more important. Use canine scissors–either blunt-nosed or sharp for trimming the hair on the pads.  If you don’t feel confident trimming your dog’s nails or the hair on the pads, ask your breeder for lessons or take your dog to a professional groomer to get the job done.  "

This makes them a target for infections. To prevent them from becoming serious, check and clean excessive wax buildup. Your breeder or veterinarian can demonstrate how to safely clean the ears and keep them debris-free.  Kind, friendly eyes complete the Lab’s in-your-face appeal. If you notice any yellow or green discharge, notify your veterinarian. Otherwise, wipe them with a clean cloth after a romp in the field or a swim in the lake.  For skin and health protection, keep your dog tick and flea free. The Lab’s double-thick coat gives these pests a great place to hide. Here’s where the daily comb and monthly bath will help you find these troublesome irritants before they have a chance to wreak havoc on your dog’s body.

These dogs can begin physical activity as early as three months of age, but Labrador puppy exercise should not be as intense (or as long in duration) as that of mature dogs. By the time they're at or near full maturity (18-24 months), a full day's exercise in 1-1½ hour sessions should be okay. And odds are, a mature Lab will wear itself (and you!) out. This breed was developed to spend all day as a working animal, so a Lab will typically have boundless amounts of energy. Canine experts say that it's up to Lab owners themselves to decide when to stop the physical activity--because these dogs surely won't! Other than that, no real precautions exist in exercise for Labrador Retrievers. They can exercise in most types of weather, too--just make sure to provide plenty of water, especially in hotter temperatures. Be aware, though, that an under-exercised Lab will be hard to handle. If these dogs don't receive plenty of physical and mental stimulation, they'll become extremely bored and hyperactive: they'll dig, bark, bound around, and chew any- and everything they can get their mouths on. Labs also have high tendencies for obesity, so a Lab will quickly become overweight if not exercised enough. Just a few of the seemingly infinite number of exercises for Labrador Retrievers: Jogging: Labs make excellent running companions Swimming: Early Labs were retrievers for fishermen, so these dogs will love a good, long swim Hide and Seek: Great indoor activity for rainy days Fetch/Frisbee: A Lab will chase a ball or Frisbee until your arm gets tired of throwing it Hiking: These dogs can hike for miles Biking: Loop the leash around the bike's handlebar and go--a Lab will keep up! Because Labs' exercise needs are great, it'll be good for owners to have frequent access to outdoor areas. When inside, make sure to have a ball or chew-toy for your Lab to fetch and chew on to release any excess energy. And if possible, try to set a daily exercise schedule for a Lab, such as one or two exercise sessions during the day, followed by a long walk, jog, or bike in the evening. One of the great things about these dogs is that they're athletic, intelligent and versatile, and can participate in many physical activities right alongside their owners."
2,https://www.dog-learn.com/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/care,"Complete Care Guide for Labrador Retrievers » Info, Tips, & More",Labrador Retriever Maintenance,"Labrador Retriever Maintenance Maintenance for this breed, at least in regards to shedding and drooling, is a moderate issue. Labrador Retriever shedding is a constant thing: a moderate amount for most of the year, and excessively during the twice-annual moulting seasons. Drooling is not a huge problem, but these dogs often drip saliva if they're near food, of if they know they're about to eat. As all Lab owners know, shed hair is a permanent thing in their households--especially during the spring and fall, when Labs lose their winter or summer coats. Fortunately, these moulting periods only last 2-3 weeks! For most of the year, brushing a Lab 3-4 times per week, along with monthly baths, will minimize the amount of shed hair; during shedding season, increase the brushing to daily, and bathe the dog a few days into the season (and again at the end, if desired). Unfortunately, the plain fact is that a Labrador will shed, regardless of what you do--so have a vacuum cleaner and lint roller ready. And Labs typically drool when they prepare to eat (or know that food is coming). One way to minimize the issue is to call the dog to its bowl before you get food out. Excessive or constant drooling--also called ptyalism --may be a sign of a medical issue, in which case you should contact a veterinarian."

As such an active breed, a Lab will need a well-balanced food regimen, one with plenty of calories. Debates have long raged over which type of food is best for these dogs: dry kibble, wet or canned, or BARF (Bones and Raw Food)? The quick answer is any and all of them. Ideally, a mature Lab will eat a combination of kibble, canned, and raw food--just make sure you're consistent and feed the dog the same type of food at each daily meal (wet/canned in the morning and kibble in the evening, for example). Though the amounts can vary depending on the type of food, the typical three-month-old Lab puppy should get approximately 3.5 ounces of food at each meal, and should be fed three times per day. As a Lab grows, owners should increase the amount per meal, and by six months of age the Lab should only be fed twice daily. A full-grown Lab needs about 10-12 ounces of food per meal, twice a day. Use the following chart as a rough guideline: Labrador Retriever Feeding Chart Dog Age Dog Weight Food Type Amount Frequency 2 Months 15 lbs. Dry 2 oz. 4x/day 3 Months 25 lbs. Dry/Wet 3.5 oz. 3x/day 6 Months 50 lbs. Dry/Wet 7 oz. 2x/day 1 Year 60 lbs. Dry/Wet/Raw 8-9 oz. 2x/day 2 Years+ 65 lbs. Dry/Wet/Raw 10-12 oz. 2x/day It's a good idea to monitor your Lab's food intake closely, because dogs of this breed tend to become overweight very easily. Unfortunately, the phrase ""fat Labradors"" has become quite common in modern society--but jokes aside, a fat Lab is more prone to joint problems, digestive and breathing issues, and decreased lifespan. If you're concerned about your Lab's weight: if it's not obvious when looking at the dog that it's overweight, a good rule of thumb is to run your hand along the dog's side. If you can't feel the rib bones, it's time for a diet. Decrease the amounts of food per meal by one-fourth (and possibly switch to all dry food, if applicable), and increase the amount of exercise; adding an extra exercise session to your overweight Lab's daily routine is a great idea."

Some say it's dry kibble, which is cheaper and more convenient. Other feed their Labs only canned food, which is more nutritious (and usually more appealing to the dog). Still others rely only on a BARF (Bones and Raw Food) diet for Labs, as it's more ""natural"" for them; if left to its own devices in the wild, they argue, a Lab would only eat raw meat, so they try and mimic that diet. So what's the recommended dog food for Labs? In reality, there's no easy answer to that question. The best case scenario is that a Lab will eat some of all three food types. Regardless, owners will need to feed their dogs at the same time every day (8 a.m. and 6 p.m., for example); they'll also want to feed the dog the same type of foods for each daily meal (like kibble every morning, canned every evening). Additionally, veterinarians highly advise against feeding a Lab human food from the dinner table. It will encourage begging, and contribute to a Lab's obesity."

As many pet parents know too well, a diet change can be stressful event for the microbiome and can trigger temporary gastric upset and loose stools. As expected, when transitioned to the control recipe, dogs showed an increase in stool score and loose stool frequency. However, when the dogs in this study were transitioned onto the Digestion + Gut Health Salmon Recipe, we did not see a negative impact on stool score or frequency of loose stools. This suggests that there was a partially protective effect of feeding this recipe on transition related digestive upset. Finally, stool score was significantly improved in pets fed this recipe, most notably seeing a reduction in the frequency of loose stools and increased grades of ideal quality. For pet owners, stool quality is often one of the most crucial indicators of a successful diet and improving this can be a meaningful indicator in the effectiveness of a gut health recipe."

Most amino acids are used to make protein, but taurine is a free amino acid in the body. 3 Though the exact function of taurine is not entirely understood, it is known to be involved in heart health. In dogs and cats, taurine also plays an important role in activating bile acids in the liver, enabling them to break down fats. 3 Cats must get taurine from their diet, but dogs can make taurine using two other amino acids, methionine and cysteine. Therefore, taurine is not considered necessary in dogs’ diets if enough methionine and cysteine are present. 3 Although the methionine content in pulses is lower compared to animal-based proteins, this can easily be accounted for by using ingredients rich in this amino acid or using supplementation. 4"

In the early 2000’s, before grain-free diets became mainstream, some lamb and rice diets were identified as being correlated with low taurine and heart disease in dogs. 5 It was suggested that the lamb meal in these diets did not provide enough methionine and cysteine. 5 However, it could not be confirmed that lamb meal was a direct cause of heart disease in dogs. Instead, it was realized that the diet as a whole must be considered to make sure it provides all the nutrients dogs need. This causes one to ask, “why are peas, lentils, and grain-free diets being blamed for causing heart disease in dogs, when we know that ingredients themselves are not the issue?” The challenge is that pointing a finger at ingredients without more in-depth information causes panic and uncertainty for pet parents without providing any fact-based answers or solutions."

Taurine and its precursors, methionine, and cysteine are naturally found in animal-based proteins. Therefore, diets that contain an adequate level of high-quality animal protein should provide sufficient levels of taurine. 6 However, lower quality animal-based proteins (i.e., those that provide low levels of one or more essential amino acid) may not provide adequate methionine and cysteine for dogs to produce enough taurine. Knowing this, it’s critical to consider ingredients’ protein quality when formulating foods for both dogs and cats. Pet foods are also often supplemented with single amino acids, particularly methionine, lysine, and taurine, to ensure they contain sufficient amounts. 3"

Cooking can also affect protein and amino acids in food. Different formats of pet food (e.g., canned versus kibble) require different cooking temperatures. Cooking pet food is also required for food safety. However, cooking protein at excessive temperatures can potentially lead to the destruction of amino acids which can decrease the amount of amino acids available for an animal to use. 7 On the flip side, not cooking ingredients enough can also be an issue.

Bile acids are then reabsorbed in the small intestine to be used again. However, certain types of fibre are thought to bind with bile acids causing the bile acids to be excreted in the feces rather than reabsorbed. 8 When this happens, the body must use more of its taurine to make bile acids, and this can decrease blood taurine levels. Furthermore, the types of bacteria in the gut may also impact taurine status. More research is needed to investigate the effects of dietary fibre and gut bacteria on taurine status."

In June 2020, a highly qualified team of board-certified veterinary nutritionists, cardiologists and PhD researchers published a literature review on DCM in dogs in the Journal of Animal Science. This review, which examined more than 200 studies, concluded that there is no definitive evidence to suggest a relationship between grain-free diets and DCM. The authors further explained that the information that has been distributed to the public thus far has largely been comprised of incomplete information and conflicting opinions. Based on their review of the literature, the authors stated it is “impossible to draw any definitive conclusions, in these cases, linking specific diets or specific ingredients to DCM”. 9 In March 2022, a retrospective study was published which investigated the increase in grain-free pet food sales over the past decade and cross-referenced this with diagnosed cases of DCM. Despite a 5-fold increase in grain free petfood sales from 2011-2019, there was not an accompanying increase in DCM cases, and no significant correlation between the two. 18 Additional research since the first FDA report has included two research papers which showed that dietary-associated DCM may occur with some grain-free diets, 10 but that the cause is likely multifactorial, resulting from a combination of dietary, metabolic, and genetic factors. 11 A cause-and-effect relationship between DCM and grain-free diets has not been proven. 12 Another study published in January 2020 examined the effects of diets containing different carbohydrate sources on taurine status in dogs. 13 The results found that there were no differences in overall taurine status or crude protein digestibility between dogs fed grain-free or grain inclusive diets. Some differences in bile acid secretion were observed between the two diet groups, which may indicate that different carbohydrate sources impact gut bacteria populations and taurine metabolism. However, the effect of these differences needs further study. This was the first study published in dogs that evaluated the effect of grain-inclusive versus grain-free diets on factors that may contribute to the development of DCM. This study further supports that a variety of factors in addition to taurine status should be considered when investigating a potential relationship between DCM and grain-free diets. An in-depth scientific review has also been published on canine diet-associated DCM by an expert panel of scientists led by researchers at the University of Guelph. 14 More recent findings from this research group found that dogs fed diets with total pulse inclusion ranging from zero to close to half of the recipe showed no biological changes indicative of DCM or pre-DCM. 18"

We approach the quality and safety of our pet foods with utmost care and we set extremely high quality and safety standards for ourselves and all of our suppliers and partners. Petcurean products are manufactured at plants which meet all regulatory requirements in addition to adhering to Petcurean’s high standards for partnership. We work with plants that are EU, FDA, and CFIA certified, meaning they must meet a very high standard of sanitation, cleanliness and manufacturing practices. Partners also participate in 3rd party audit programs, such as BRC or GFSI alongside our own partnership audits lead by a certified Food Safety and Quality auditor. Our unique recipes are crafted using the highest quality ingredients which begins with a qualification program to approve all ingredient suppliers. Even when approved we test all ingredients prior to receiving them at the plant; quality assurance tests include, but are not limited to, vomitoxin, aflatoxin, zearalenone, nutritional integrity and moisture levels. Testing continues on every batch at each part of the manufacturing process built on standards set by Health Canada. We use Near Infra Red [NIR] technology during production to accurately measure the fat, protein and moisture content of the food. Prior to release, each batch is subject to further nutritional and quality testing, including for Enterobacteriaceae such as salmonella. Food is only shipped when favorable results are returned for all parameters. We keep final tested food samples of all lots produced in our nutrition office and regularly perform supplemental quality and nutrition testing for our own internal quality program. Other components of our quality program include traceability of all products, each batch of food can be tracked immediately using our complete and thorough tracking protocol.

6,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/pet-food-safety-quality-control-faqs,Pet Food Safety & Quality Control FAQs | Petcurean,What is the best way to store dry food?,"What is the best way to store dry food? Short answer: Dry food is best stored indoors in a cool dry place. If there is no zip closure, the top should be rolled down as far as possible and, if feasible, put in an airtight container, in the original bag. Dry food can also be frozen or refrigerated to maintain freshness. (Slightly!) longer answer: Correct storage of pet food is extremely important to ensure the food is kept fresh (and enjoyable for your pet) and to ensure the well-being of your pet is protected. Petcurean kibble is cooked and carefully dried to a specific moisture level before it’s placed in the bag (to prevent mold from forming). To ensure that mold spores from environmental moisture don’t develop, be sure to store your kibble in a cool, dry location. Moist areas (like basements or crawl spaces), open containers, or areas where condensation or temperature fluctuations exist encourage mold to grow. What about pouring your kibble into a storage container? We receive an abundance of phone calls from our customers who profess they have the best dog food storage, e.g. the dreaded Rubbermaid tub. Pouring pet food into these containers is absolutely not a good idea for two key reasons: many of these containers are not airtight (plastic is porous by nature), and fat and oils can be absorbed into the plastic, risking the opportunity for rancidity to occur. So what is the best way to store my food? In the Petcurean bag you purchased for your pet at your local pet specialty retailer, stored in a cool, dry area of course! Petcurean Team A Team of Dedicated Pet Parents + Nutrition Experts Store open, sealed bags in an airtight container for an added level of protection. Can I refrigerate or freeze my food?

In pet food, vitamins and minerals are usually added as a “premix”. Premixes help ensure the correct level of nutrients are evenly distributed in the finished product. With a premix, the micronutrients are mixed twice – once when the premix is made and again when the premix is added to the food. Premixes are a lot more complex than just a simple blend of nutrients. Many factors are taken into consideration when designing a vitamin or mineral premix, including the nutrient quality, bioavailability, stability, and physical characteristics. Whether it is a vitamin, mineral or other nutritional supplement, strict quality control must be in place to ensure consistency and safety . Vitamins and minerals are added in very small amounts to pet foods, and while a little goes a long way, more is not necessarily better and can even cause harm. It is vital that quality is maintained to ensure correct inclusion rates in the final product. Bioavailability is the degree and rate in which a substance is absorbed by an animal. If a vitamin or mineral cannot be absorbed, then it cannot play its essential role in the body. Dr. Jennifer Adolphe PhD (Companion Animal Nutrition) Nutrients need to be in a form that protects the nutrient from breaking down during cooking and food storage, but is released via digestion for usage by the pet. Many nutrients react with the environment, specifically oxygen, moisture, and heat. Adequate stabilization protects the nutrient from degradation and is critical to ensuring correct nutrient levels in the food through to the end of its shelf life. Vitamins and minerals are only needed in very small quantities, so it is critical to ensure even distribution of the premix into the food. Differences in particle size and structure can result in uneven distribution of nutrients when mixing. Imagine mixing magnetized metal balls with non-magnetized wooden balls – no matter how long the balls are mixed they would not be evenly distributed. Particle size, shape, and density play roles in creating an even mixture and ensure stability until the food is enjoyed by your pet."

Vitamin and mineral supplementation is used in kibble and canned pet foods to balance the nutrient composition and to ensure the healthiest pet foods possible. These supplements are used to provide essential nutrients in the correct ratios required by dogs and cats. While our goal is to use nutrient-rich ingredients to minimize the need for supplementation, nutrition and food science tells us that optimal nutrition cannot always be achieved by natural food sources alone, making supplementation of pet food necessary.

For dogs and cats, the FDA reported the MTL to be 12.5 mg/kg on a dry matter (DM) basis. 4 In comparison, the MTL for domestic animals set by the MTSA Committee is 30 mg/kg DM. 1 The average (± SD) arsenic content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods as tested by an independent laboratory was found to be 0.39 ± 0.41 mg/kg on an as fed basis (0.43 ± 0.46 mg/kg DM or 3.4% of the MTL)."
2,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/heavy-metals-pet-food,Heavy Metals in Pet Food | Petcurean,Cadmium,"Cadmium Cadmium is not considered an essential nutrient for animals, though studies in rodents, chickens and livestock have shown increased weight gain with the addition of low levels of cadmium to the diet. 1 Absorption of cadmium by the intestines depends on the dose, with higher doses being absorbed more readily. Cadmium seems to increase its own bioavailability by disrupting the intestinal cell barrier. However, with chronic exposure, absorption of cadmium decreases due to the development of protective mechanisms. 1  Chronic cadmium consumption in food or water affects almost all major organs, with the kidney and liver being the target organs for most animals. 1 The toxicity of cadmium is affected by the nutritional and physiological state of the animal. 1 Dogs fed cadmium chloride at concentrations of 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg diet for three months were found to be clinically normal. 5 Dogs have been shown to tolerate cadmium at a level of 10 mg/kg DM for eight years with no adverse effects, but 50 mg/kg DM over the same time period resulted in renal atrophy, renal tubule degeneration and diminished renal function. 1 The MTL for cadmium for mammalian species was set by the MTSA Committee at 10 mg/kg DM, 1 which is the same as the level reported by the FDA for dogs and cats. 4 The average (± SD) cadmium content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods as tested by an independent laboratory was found to be 0.09 ± 0.05 mg/kg as fed (0.1 ± 0.06 mg/kg DM or 1% of the MTL)."
3,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/heavy-metals-pet-food,Heavy Metals in Pet Food | Petcurean,Chromium,"Chromium Chromium has been recognized as an essential nutrient since the mid-twentieth century when it was recognized as being essential for glucose metabolism by increasing the effectiveness of insulin. 1,6 Chromium deficiency in humans results in glucose intolerance, weight loss and disorders of the nervous system. 1  Chromium is abundant in water and soil, though uptake by plants and absorption by animals is low. 7 Most forms of chromium are poorly available, except for organically bound chromium which is better absorbed. 7 Chromium toxicity is a concern in humans exposed to chromium in occupational and industrial settings. 1 Dogs have a chromium requirement estimated to be less than 12 μg/kg body weight per day. 6 Diabetic dogs treated with insulin showed no beneficial or harmful effects with supplementation of chromium picolinate at a dosage of 20-60 mg/kg/d. 8 In obese and non-obese cats, supplementation with 100 μg/d chromium picolinate for six weeks was found to be safe, but had no effect on glucose tolerance. 9 No definitive intake recommendations have been made for dogs or cats due to insufficient evidence. 6  The MTL for mammalian species was reported by the NRC to be 100 mg chromium/kg DM from soluble sources such as chromium chloride. 1,4 However, none of the species with an MTL were identified as being particularly sensitive to chromium and there was a lack of dog- or cat-specific data. 4 Therefore, a safety factor of 10 was applied to the general mammalian MTL, resulting in a value of 10 mg chromium/kg DM for dogs and cats. 4 The average (± SD) chromium content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods was found to be 1.24 ± 0.72 mg/kg as fed (1.38 ± 0.8 mg/kg DM or 13.8% of the MTL)."
4,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/heavy-metals-pet-food,Heavy Metals in Pet Food | Petcurean,Lead,"Lead Lead is a significant environmental pollutant with a high degree of toxicity and is not known to be essential for animals. 1 The bioavailability of lead is affected by the chemical form, the level of other dietary constituents, and the age and physiological state of the animal. 1 Lead acts as a toxin by interacting with body proteins and changing their function, inhibiting or mimicking the action of calcium, replacing zinc as a cofactor in enzymes, and inducing oxidative stress. Animals can tolerate considerably higher daily lead exposure when it is consumed in the diet compared to when it is delivered in the water. 1 Acute lead poisoning in dogs results in anorexia, salivation, vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by spasmodic colic. 10 Death in dogs from acute exposure occurs at doses of 191 mg/kg body weight for lead acetate, 1300 mg/kg body weight for lead oxide and 1366 mg lead/kg body weight for lead sulphate. 1 Dogs have been shown to tolerate 10 mg lead/kg diet without any changes in red blood cell production or kidney function.1In a two year feeding study with dogs, lead at a concentration of 50 mg/kg diet was tolerated without hematological changes, though some changes were observed at dosages of 100 and 500 mg/kg diet. 1 The MTL for mammalian species for lead was reported by the NRC to be 10 mg/kg DM, 1 which as noted above, has been shown to be tolerated by dogs. The average (± SD) lead content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods was found to be 0.16 ± 0.11 mg/kg as fed (0.18 ± 0.12 mg/kg DM or 1.8 % of the MTL)."

Inorganic mercury is usually strongly bound and is less available for absorption by animals. 1 However, bacteria can convert inorganic mercury to organic mercury (methylmercury), which can then enter the food chain. Methylmercury is more toxic than inorganic forms because its bioavailability is significantly greater. 1 Animals accumulate organic mercury faster than they can eliminate it, so animals higher up in the food chain generally consume higher concentrations of mercury. 1 Fish products are the primary dietary source of methylmercury, with long-lived predatory fish, such as swordfish and tuna, containing the highest levels. Cats are more sensitive to methylmercury than most other animal species. 4 The FDA reports an MTL of 0.267 mg/kg DM for organic mercury in non-reproducing cats. For reproducing cats, the MTL was calculated to be 0.067 mg/kg DM. 4 The average (± SD) mercury content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods was found to be 0.01 ± 0.01 mg/kg as fed (0.01 ± 0.02 mg/kg DM or 3.7% of the MTL)."

The average (± SD) nickel content in a selection of Petcurean dry kibble foods was found to be 1.11 ± 0.40mg/kg as fed (1.23 ± 0.44 mg/kg DM or 2.5% of the MTL)."
7,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/heavy-metals-pet-food,Heavy Metals in Pet Food | Petcurean,Summary,"Nutrition is a balancing act to ensure adequate intake of all essential nutrients while preventing excesses. It can be just as detrimental to consume a diet with inadequate concentrations of a nutrient as it can be to have high intake levels. Minerals, including heavy metals, are naturally occurring elements in all foods – the key is controlling the levels in finished products to ensure correct amounts are present. The National Research Council and United States Food and Drug Administration have published recommendations for the maximum tolerable levels of many minerals, including heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel. The results of testing Petcurean dog and cat foods at an independent laboratory for heavy metals show that the average levels are well below the MTL for each metal, providing support for our goal of putting pets first in every decision we make.

Grains are an important source of complex carbohydrates, which are more slowly digested compared to simple carbohydrates. Although carbohydrates are not considered essential nutrients in the diets of dogs and cats and are often mislabeled as “fillers,” they do play a critical role in your pet’s body. In particular, carbohydrates provide a highly digestible, readily available energy source. Foods which are rich in complex carbohydrates are also an important source of essential nutrients. The shape, texture and density of kibble and wet food also depend on the carbohydrate (starch) content of the food. This is important, as mouthfeel and the structure of food help to determine palatability."
2,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/grain-free-or-grain-inclusive,Grain Free or Grain Inclusive? | Petcurean,Can dogs and cats use carbohydrates from grains?,"Can dogs and cats use carbohydrates from grains? Yes! Recent genetic research suggests that one of the important steps in the domestication of dogs was their adaptation to a diet higher in carbohydrates relative to the diet of carnivorous wolves. Although carbohydrates are not considered essential for cats, research suggests that moderate amounts may actually be beneficial in promoting insulin sensitivity. Another benefit of dietary carbohydrates is that they, along with fat, are body’s preferred source of energy; using protein as an energy source can be inefficient and expensive, both metabolically and environmentally. Some of the grains commonly found in pet foods Barley Corn Rice Oats Millet Whole grains include all parts of the grain, while refined grains have the nutrient-rich germ and bran layers removed. Whole grains support digestive health since they are not only an excellent source of complex carbohydrates but are also rich in fibre. Dietary fibre is a unique type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested by your pet’s digestive enzymes, but nonetheless provides many benefits. For example, oats and barley contain a special type of fibre called beta-glucan, which has been shown in numerous human studies to fight heart disease and diabetes. Beta-glucan may also be beneficial in pet foods to help support a healthy weight."

Some pets may have intolerances to one or more specific grains, but it might not be necessary to eliminate all grains. Grain-free does not mean carbohydrate-free, as complex carbohydrates are found in many non-grain ingredients such as peas, lentils, chickpeas, tapioca, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Gluten-free diets are necessary for humans diagnosed with celiac disease or nonceliac gluten sensitivity, but this is not a common problem in pets and most tolerate gluten without any difficulty. The exception is some Irish Setters with inherited gluten sensitivity. Theresa Lantz Companion Animal Nutritionist Many grain-free pet foods are higher in protein than their grain-inclusive counterparts. Since all foods contain a balance of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, decreasing the amount of carbohydrate in a food will increase the fat and/or protein content. While extra protein is typically not a problem for most healthy pets, it can be problematic in certain medical conditions such as later stages of kidney disease, or pancreatitis in the case of increased fat."

Pulse ingredients such as lentils, peas and chickpeas are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins, and minerals, and provide most of the essential amino acids required by dogs and cats. Uniquely, peas provide an added environmental benefit in that they are used as a tool in sustainable agriculture to add nitrogen back into the soil. Potatoes are a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C and potassium. Cooked potatoes are also rich in prebiotic fibre which can support a healthy gut microbiome and good quality stools. Tapioca provides a novel source of energy and does not contain protein, so it is not typically considered a potential allergen or source of food sensitivity.

Pet foods contain a variety of different protein sources which are used to provide adequate amounts of essential and non-essential amino acids. It is crucial to understand that animals don’t require specific protein sources; rather, they require adequate levels of specific amino acids, which can be supplied by both plant and animal proteins. The body does not differentiate whether the amino acids came from plant- or animal-based ingredients. Petcurean Team A Team of Dedicated Pet Parents + Nutrition Experts Both animal protein and plant protein sources have advantages and disadvantages that pet food formulators must consider when developing a diet. Animal proteins provide a high-quality balance of amino acids and are sources of fat and minerals, but they are less sustainable and can vary significantly in nutrient composition and quality. On the other hand, plant proteins are less variable in their nutrient composition, are a source of vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre, and are a more environmentally-friendly option (Boye et al., 2010).

High protein diets may not be ideal, or even suitable, for all dogs. When protein is consumed in excess of the body’s requirements, it is broken down into nitrogen-containing compounds and filtered out as waste in the urine. Healthy dogs can handle extra protein, but dogs with renal insufficiency, which is more common amongst older dogs, may benefit from a lower protein diet. Many of the clinical signs of late stage renal insufficiency, such as vomiting and lack of appetite, result from of a build-up of these nitrogenous end products. Feeding a diet that is restricted in protein allows the kidneys to work less and prevents an accumulation of these waste products. However, high quality protein ingredients that provide all essential amino acids in the amount pets require is recommended to help reduce the quantity of waste that the kidneys must eliminate."

Regulatory agencies review and test foods on the market to make sure they comply with their labels and do not contain contaminants. However, all food is susceptible to a recall if a regulatory body determines that it poses a hazard to human or animal health. Hundreds of human food recalls occur in North America every year, compared with only a handful of pet food recalls. It is in everyone’s best interest to keep the food supply as safe as possible for ourselves and our pets. Though mistakes can happen, nutrition and food science technologies developed over the past several decades have created a safe food supply to feed millions of humans and their pets."

For example, some people are concerned about lectins (a type of carbohydrate-binding protein) in peas. Lectins are believed to have evolved to protect the plant by causing intestinal discomfort in animals that eat them. However, lectins must be consumed raw in large quantities to produce this discomfort, and moderate heat treatment, such as that used to make dry and canned pet foods, inactivates the anti-nutritional properties of lectins (Roy et al., 2010). In fact, controlled amounts of anti-nutritional factors may have health-promoting properties. Data in humans suggests that when properly processed, lectins may help to prevent or treat certain diseases such as heart disease and diabetes by helping to control obesity (Roy et al., 2010). Preliminary research has shown that lectins also may have anti-cancer and immune-boosting effects (Roy et al., 2010)."

Vitamin manufacturers have developed sophisticated technologies to produce the most useful and stable forms of individual vitamins, which are well utilized and handled by the body. Many factors are taken into consideration when designing a vitamin or mineral premix, including the nutrient quality, bioavailability, stability, and physical characteristics. Whether it is a vitamin, mineral, or other nutritional supplement, strict quality control is put in place to ensure consistency and safety. Furthermore, since many nutrients react with other food components, adequate stabilization protects the nutrient from degradation and is critical to ensuring correct nutrient levels in the food. There is no research to support defining synthetic vitamins as dangerous when fed in appropriate levels for dogs and cats. Any nutrient can be harmful if fed in excessive levels, whether the source is from foods or supplements. Read more about vitamin supplementation in pet food."

Although food processing will impact the microbiome, research in this area is still relatively new and it is unknown whether processing has negative effects. While processed foods in the human food industry are often viewed unfavourably because many of them are high in fat, salt, and sugar, this is not the case for most pet foods. Petcurean Team A Team of Dedicated Pet Parents + Nutrition Experts There are many advantages to processing food. Processing technologies have evolved significantly over the years to create safe, convenient, nutrient-dense foods, and help secure a stable supply. Processing can increase the digestibility of some macronutrients, allowing them to be more readily absorbed (Tran et al., 2008). Cooking food is a key step in maintaining food safety by destroying harmful pathogens; undercooked meat is a well-known source of pathogens for both humans and animals. Additionally, processing allows manufacturers to incorporate fibre into kibble, which can subsequently act as a food source for the beneficial bacteria in the GI tract, thereby promoting a beneficial microbiome for the animal."

A lack of dietary carbohydrates results in intestinal bacteria using amino acids as their energy source, leading to an increased production of ammonia, a foul-smelling compound excreted in the urine. Additionally, we are not aware of any research that supports a negative correlation between carbohydrate content and nutrient assimilation in cats or dogs. Carbohydrates, namely starch and dietary fibre, are important components of pet foods. Although carbohydrates are often considered ‘fillers’, they do play a critical role in your pet’s body. In particular, carbohydrates provide a highly digestible, readily available energy source. Foods rich in complex carbohydrates are also an important source of essential nutrients. Fat and carbohydrate are the preferred energy sources for the body, but protein can also be broken down to provide energy. However, animals are unable to store excess amino acids. What is not utilized for tissue maintenance must be dealt with by the liver and kidneys. When compared to carbohydrates and fats, protein as an energy source is metabolically expensive due to the structure of amino acids. The body must first break protein down into amino acids to be utilized for energy. If the amino acids are not needed by the body for another purpose, the nitrogen portion of the amino acids is converted in the liver to an end-product called urea which is excreted in urine, and the carbon portion of the amino acid is converted to fat. Nitrogen, from urea and other sources, is an environmental contaminant. Overfeeding protein by reducing carbohydrates not only serves as an inefficient use of energy but also leads to increased nitrogen (i.e. urea) excretion and environmental ammonia levels. The more protein that is fed above requirements, the more urea is excreted. High concentrations of urea in the urine result in yellow and burnt spots in grass."

It is one of the safest methods of preservation; without it, tremendous amounts of food would be wasted. Cold temperature storage helps keep food fresher for longer and keeps food safe by decreasing the water activity and reducing the multiplication, resistance, and survival of potentially harmful organisms (Leistner, 1992). Appropriate packaging prevents the gain or loss of moisture. Moisture loss, or ice crystals evaporating from the surface of a product, can occur during frozen food storage which causes freezer burn and a loss in product quality. However, this is easily prevented with proper packaging. Fat oxidation is what contributes to food going rancid. Fresh meats and fish spoil quickly at room temperature due to bacterial growth. This can be slowed using refrigeration, but the shelf life only extends by a few days. On the other hand, freezing greatly extends the length of time a food can be stored. While fat oxidation and a decrease in omega-3 fatty acid content can occur in frozen foods that have been stored for many weeks, there are significant benefits to freezing for maintaining food safety and quality of fresh meats and fish. Freezing at lower temperatures and rapidly freezing food helps to reduce fat oxidation. Since many people and their pets do not live next to an ocean or lake where fresh fish is abundant, freezing helps increase accessibility to these types of nutritious foods."

AAFCO does not permit labelling of carbohydrate levels; however, it does permit labelling dietary starch and sugars in the Guaranteed Analysis, which are types of carbohydrates. AAFCO does not allow a claim of “low carbohydrates,” “low dietary starch,” or “low sugars.” Furthermore, AAFCO has specific rules about making comparison claims for carbohydrate, dietary starch or sugars (i.e. the amount present in one food compared to that in another food). Since there is often a lack of space on packaging for all the required information, pet food companies must be selective about which information to include.

There is no evidence to substantiate a “ 30/7.5% ” or “ 15/1.5% rule ”. There is, however, research to support the fact that both cats and dogs can readily digest and metabolize carbohydrates, even at high levels (Asaro et al., 2018; deOliveira et al., 2008). Carbohydrates provide a highly digestible, readily available energy source. During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, the preferred energy source for certain body cells, including the brain. In addition, the consumption of carbohydrates allows protein to be spared for producing and maintaining body tissue, rather than being used for energy production. In humans, some digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. Dogs do not have this oral enzyme, so carbohydrates are only broken down in the small intestine. Dietary fibre is a unique type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested by a dog’s enzymes. However, it has many benefits.

Here is an example: ""Go! Solutions Skin + Coat Care Chicken Recipe is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages including growth of large size dogs (70lbs or more as an adult)."" In the pet food world, these statements indicate if a food is “complete and balanced”. For a recipe to be designated as complete and balanced, it must meet all the nutrient requirements of a pet. An organization called the Association of American Feed Control Officials , or AAFCO, publishes specific nutrient recommendations for dogs and cats for two specific life stages: growth & reproduction ; and adult maintenance . These guidelines incorporate the most current information on optimal nutrition for dogs and cats based on scientific research. Meeting these AAFCO nutrient targets provides reassurance that the food meets the nutritional requirements of the animal. Therefore, if the food states that it is formulated to meet the AAFCO nutrient profiles, then it is complete and balanced and must contain all the nutrients needed to be a pet’s only source of nutrition. The AAFCO nutrient profiles are also helpful since they report the minimum recommendation of each nutrient required for a pet. So, if your pet requires a food that is high or low in a specific nutrient, you can compare the nutrient level in the food to the minimum and maximum values published in the AAFCO nutrient profiles.

Well, on the Petcurean website, you can find our nutrient profiles that outline the specific nutrient makeup for every Now Fresh , Go! Solutions and Gather recipe. These profiles are a convenient way to determine the amount of each nutrient in your pet’s food. When looking at our nutrient profiles, you will notice that nutrient levels are presented in three different ways: on a dry matter basis; on an as fed basis; and on a per kilocalorie basis. But, what do these mean? Well, dry matter is the value for a nutrient assuming all moisture in the food is removed. Dry matter is used because it provides information about the nutrient content of foods on a uniform basis. Nutrient levels in foods with different moisture contents (e.g. wet versus dry recipes) can be directly compared when reported on a dry matter basis. Also, AAFCO publishes their nutrient recommendations on a dry matter basis, so this column allows you to directly compare a recipe to the AAFCO nutrient profiles and be sure that the food is complete and balanced. On the other hand, ‘as fed’ is the value for a nutrient as it is found in the food itself, including the moisture content. This is also as you would feed it to your pet. This information is helpful if you wanted to calculate how much food you need to feed to provide your pet with a specific amount of a particular nutrient. Reading the label of a pet food bag does not always tell you all of the information you need to know and that’s why the nutrient profiles are so important. Say you need a lower fat food to help your pet shed a few pounds and you’re trying to decide between two foods: NOW FRESH Recipe for Adult Dogs kibble and NOW FRESH Turkey Stew for Dogs . The Guaranteed Analysis on the bag is reported on an ‘as fed’ basis, but when comparing foods with different amounts of moisture, it’s important to compare nutrient levels on a ‘dry matter’ basis. This is where the nutrient profiles come in handy; we’ve already done all of the math for you! The NOW FRESH Turkey Stew has a fat content of 23% on a dry matter basis, while the NOW FRESH Adult kibble has a fat content of 18% . In this situation, you would choose the NOW FRESH Adult kibble recipe because it’s lower in fat. NOW FRESH Recipe for Adult Dogs kibble Nutrient Profile example NOW FRESH Turkey Stew for Dogs Nutrient Profile example Since animals must eat food in an amount that meets their energy requirements, it’s important to know nutrient intake on a ‘per calorie’ basis. That’s why we also conveniently provide nutrient levels on a “Per 1000 kcal” basis in every nutrient profile. This column shows you the amount of each nutrient your pet would consume if they were to eat 1000 calories of food. For example, if your dog ate 1000 calories of Go! Solutions Skin + Coat Care Chicken Recipe with Grains for Dogs , they would receive 67.6 grams of protein, 38.6 grams of fat, and 4.63 grams of fibre. Just like nutrient levels on a ‘dry matter basis’, the ‘per calorie basis’ allows direct comparison of nutrient levels between foods with different moisture levels. AAFCO also reports nutrient requirements on a per calorie basis. This column shows you the amount of each nutrient your pet would consume if they were to eat 1000 calories of food."

Organic production is designed to optimize the agricultural ecosystem by focusing on the health of the soil, plants, livestock and people. The primary goal of organic production is to use farming practices that are sustainable and harmonious with the environment. While some certifications have a very narrow focus, organic is a multi-faceted certification that encompasses animal welfare and environmental sustainability, while prohibiting the use of genetically engineered (i.e. GMO) plants or animals. Key aspects of organic production include: Soil health: Maintaining and enhancing soil fertility by promoting optimal biological activity in the soil and conserving soil resources. Pest management: Weeds, pests and disease are controlled through biological and mechanical methods and minimizing tillage. Prior to becoming organic certified, prohibited substances, such as certain pesticides, may not be used on the farm for at least three years. Crop planning: Crop selection and rotation are used to promote nutrient cycling, recycling of plant and animal residues, water management, attracting beneficial insects and promoting biological diversity. Genetically engineered crops are prohibited. Humane animal treatment: Livestock are managed using practices that strive to minimize stress, promote health and prevent disease. Livestock are provided with living conditions and space allowances to meet their behavioural requirements and receive organically produced feed. In Canada, the term organic is regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Organic standards vary from country to country, but Canada has mutual agreements in place with the United States, European Union, Switzerland and Japan to allow certified foods from these countries to also be considered certified in Canada and vice versa. National organic standards have not been set for pet food, so the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) in the United States recommends that pet foods follow the labelling guidelines for human organic foods. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program (NOP) has established four labeling categories for organic products: 100 percent organic: All of the ingredients in the product must be certified organic. Products may bear the organic seal on the packaging. Organic: Must contain a minimum of 95% organic ingredients. Products may bear the organic seal on the packaging. Made with organic: Must contain at least 70% organic ingredients. The organic seal cannot be displayed on the packaging, but the principal display panel may state “made with organic ________” and list up to three ingredients. Specific ingredient listings: Foods that contain less that 70% organic ingredients may only state the organic ingredients in the ingredient statement. These products cannot bear the organic seal on the packaging or state the word ‘organic’ anywhere on the principal display panel. In addition, in order to include the Canada Organic or USDA Organic logos, the product must be manufactured in a facility that is certified organic. For the Gather Free Acres and Endless Valley recipes, the organic ingredient content is greater than 70% but less than 95% and the manufacturing facility is not a certified organic facility. Thus, we cannot use the certified organic logos on our packaging."

Also, the fishery must comply with the relevant rules and regulations and be adaptive to changing circumstances. For a product to bear the MSC ecolabel, the entire supply chain, from the fishery to the manufacturer of the end product, is required to undertake independent audits to guarantee that the MSC certified seafood is harvested using sustainable methods and is traceable throughout the supply chain. The MSC only certifies fisheries that harvest wild fish, whereas the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certifies fish produced from sustainable fish farms. The MSC program is the only program of its kind that complies with the best practice guidelines set by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance. Several other seafood sustainability programs exist that simply provide recommendations for choosing sustainable seafood. These are not certification programs and do not require third-party audits of fisheries or manufacturers to ensure sustainability of the individual fishery."

Many vegetarian pet parents wish to feed their pets the same type and quality of food that they feed themselves. Dogs, but not cats, are able to meet their nutrient requirements from a plant-only diet. Vegan Action is a non-profit organization that has created the Certified Vegan standard to recognize foods that do not contain any animal products. The primary criteria for a product to receive the Certified Vegan logo are that the producer must prove that no ingredients were sourced from animals, no animal testing is permitted, adequate segregation of vegan and non-vegan ingredients must be ensured and adequate cleanout procedures must be followed in facilities that produce vegan and non-vegan products.

Unlike cats who have requirements for nutrients that are only found in animal tissue,dogs are able to meet their nutrient requirements from a plant-only diet. A study that examined the safety of a vegetarian diet for dogs found that Siberian Husky sled dogs fed a meat-free diet for 16 weeks, including 10 weeks of competitive racing, had normal blood values and were in excellent physical condition upon veterinary examination. 2 However, there are several nutrients that are found primarily in animal food sources that require special attention when creating a vegan diet for dogs. Protein Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. There are ten essential amino acids that dogs must obtain from their diet. Protein from foods is broken down in the digestive tract to amino acids which are then used to make body proteins for tissue maintenance and repair as well as production of antibodies and enzymes. Protein can also be used as an energy source, though carbohydrate and fat are preferred so that protein can be spared for its other vital functions. Animal proteins are considered high quality proteins because they provide all of the essential amino acids in the correct amounts required by dogs. Plant proteins are often lower in one or more essential amino acid (limiting amino acid), but this can easily be corrected by eating complementary plant protein sources. For example, oats and peas have different amino acid profiles that together provide all essential amino acids (figure1). By providing a variety of plant-based protein sources, complete and balanced vegan diets for dogs are able to provide sufficient levels of protein and all essential amino acids. Figure 1. Complementary proteins from oats and peas when combined provide all essential amino acids Taurine Taurine is an amino acid found in animal tissue. It is not used to make body proteins, but plays a key role in retinal function, cardiac function, reproduction and growth. Dogs can make taurine from the amino acids cysteine and methionine when these amino acids are provided in sufficient amounts. 3 However, some breeds and conditions are associated with decreased taurine synthesis and a dietary source of taurine is required. 4 Taurine is available as a supplement produced from non-animal origin material that can be used in vegan dog diets to ensure adequate dietary taurine. Fatty acids Dietary fat is a source of energy, but also provides essential fatty acids that are required for various metabolic reactions. Dogs require dietary sources of both omega-6 andomega-3 fatty acids. Vegetable oils, such as sunflower oil, are rich sources of omega-6linoleic acid and flaxseed is high in omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid. Vitamin A Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in animal food sources and plays a key role in maintaining healthy skin, eyes and immune system. Dogs, like humans, can also make vitamin A from carotenoids 3 (e.g. beta-carotene) which are found in plant foods. Although dogs can meet their vitamin A requirement from beta-carotene, pet foods are supplemented with vitamin A. A vegan vitamin A supplement is available for dog diets which is produced from material of non-animal origin. Vitamin D Vitamin D is important for calcium metabolism for the maintenance of bones and teeth and is also involved in the function of muscles, nerves and the immune system. There are two forms of vitamin D. Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, is usually the form produced by plants. Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is the form produced from ultraviolet sunlight exposure on the skin, but synthesis is considered to be insignificant in dogs 5 and a dietary source is required. There are only a few foods that are natural sources of vitamin D, such as fatty fish like salmon as well as egg yolks. Vitamin D2 is available as a supplement for vegan dog diets. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is important for normal blood cell and nerve function. Natural sources of this vitamin are only found in animal foods. However, vitamin B12 is available as a supplement made from non-animal origin materials suitable for use in vegan diets."

The ingredients for a complete and balanced vegan diet are carefully selected to provide all of the nutrients required by dogs. Peas and lentils are locally grown crops that are nutrient-rich and offer environmental benefits. They are an excellent source of carbohydrate, fibre, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals. In addition, peas are used as a tool in sustainable agriculture because they contribute to soil health by adding nitrogen. Organic oats and barley are whole grains. They offer a complementary essential amino acid profile to peas and lentils which allows a vegan diet to provide all of the essential amino acids that dogs require. Sunflower oil is a non-genetically engineered crop that provides the essential omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid. Potato and quinoa are sources of protein and carbohydrate. Blueberries, cranberries and carrots are nutrient-rich and high in antioxidants. Primary dried yeast is a nutritional yeast that is a source of protein and B vitamins. Vitamin, mineral and amino acid supplements are included in most pet foods, and particularly vegan diets, to ensure that adequate levels of these essential nutrients are provided."

The amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat in a complete and balanced vegan diet is similar to many commercial diets that contain meat. The primary ingredients in a vegan diet, grains and pulses (peas and lentils), provide a mixture of protein, carbohydrate and fat. The grinding and cooking of these ingredients during kibble production makes these ingredients highly digestible. Fibre, the indigestible portion of food, impacts digestive health and stool quality and volume. As shown in the guaranteed analysis on the petfood label, the crude fibre content in a vegan diet is generally similar to that of diets that contain meat. This blog was originally published on October 20th, 2016. Revised July 2021."
1,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/amino-acids,Amino Acids | Petcurean,Essential vs. Non-Essential Amino Acids,"Essential vs. Non-Essential Amino Acids In total, there are 22 amino acids that pets require. Twelve of these, classified as non-essential amino acids, can be synthesized by pets. The remaining 10, which cannot be synthesized by the body, must be obtained through the diet, and therefore are called essential amino acids. It is important that diets formulated for pets contain adequate amounts of these essential amino acids to meet nutrient requirements. Cats also require one extra amino acid-like compound, called taurine. Taurine is found naturally in animal-based ingredients and is also available as a supplement. It is critical for a cat’s normal heart, eye, and reproductive function. Because it plays such a critical role for health, it is often added to cat food. Essential Amino Acids for Dogs and Cats *Arginine Histidine Isoleucine Leucine Lysine Methionine Phenylalanine Tryptophan Threonine Valine **Taurine *Essential for dogs and cats, but not essential for many other adult animals. **Essential for cats; may be conditionally essential for some dogs."
2,https://petcurean.com/en-eu/amino-acids,Amino Acids | Petcurean,Different sources of protein and amino acids,"Each protein source is unique in the amount and type of amino acids that it supplies. However, the structure of an amino acid is the same regardless of the protein source. In other words, the body does not differentiate between amino acids from plant sources or meat sources, and both are excellent options to provide protein to pets. The ability of a protein to be used by the body is defined as its protein quality or biological value. Animal proteins are considered high quality proteins because they provide all of the essential amino acids in the correct amounts required by pets. Plant proteins are often lower in one or more essential amino acid (limiting amino acid), but this can easily be corrected by eating complementary plant protein sources. For example, oats and peas have different amino acid profiles that together provide all essential amino acids (figure1). Figure 1. Complementary proteins from oats and peas when combined provide all essential amino acids When amino acid requirements cannot be met using whole food ingredients alone, individual amino acids are available to be used as a supplement in the diet. Because the environmental impact of producing animal protein is much higher than that of plant-based protein, formulating recipes using plant-based proteins in combination with moderate levels of animal protein is a sustainable way of meeting the amino acid requirements of pets.

Do you have potato-free or low carbohydrate recipes?,"My dog has a yeast infection. Do you have potato-free or low carbohydrate recipes? It has been suggested that eating foods that contain carbohydrates increases the risk of a dog or cat developing a yeast infection. Yeast does indeed need carbohydrates (i.e. glucose) for growth, however, glucose can be produced in the body from other nutrients, such as protein. It’s highly unlikely for food sources to cause an infection because normal, healthy bodies are very good at regulating blood glucose levels, preventing an excess of glucose available in the blood for the yeast to feed and thrive on. If a yeast infection does occur, it is much more likely that the body has been made vulnerable by an unrelated illness or allergy (environmental or foodborne). Pets with diabetes, however, have problems with the production or function of the hormone insulin, and can be more susceptible to yeast infections due to elevated blood glucose levels.

Because taurine is considered an essential nutrient for cats, many complete and balanced cat foods are supplemented with taurine to ensure adequate levels. Dog foods are less likely to be supplemented with taurine since it is not considered essential for dogs. For breeds that are at higher risk for developing taurine-associated DCM, a food with added taurine is recommended. The type of dietary protein and other ingredients may affect taurine status. For example, in dogs, soybean protein has been shown to increase the rate of excretion of bile acids that are bound to taurine. 6 In cats, diets containing rice bran or low quality, heat-damaged protein have been associated with an increased dietary taurine requirement due to accelerated gastrointestinal taurine losses. 6 Some evidence has suggested that diets containing lamb meal and/or rice may be associated with taurine-deficient DCM. 7 Although more evidence is needed to support this finding, as a precaution many lamb-based dog diets are supplemented with taurine."

This level is more than adequate to supply essential amino acids for most pets. There are a few cases where higher protein levels are needed, such as for performance animals or critically ill patients. Conversely, decreased levels of protein may be necessary for specific heath issues. It is important to remember that dietary protein provided in excess of the pet’s requirements cannot be stored by the body. Rather, what is not utilized for tissue maintenance or energy production will be stored as fat and the products of protein metabolism will be excreted in the urine, which is a wasteful end to a costly ingredient and contributes to harmful environmental ammonia levels. For dogs specifically, excessive protein can cause gastrointestinal issues and may contribute to diarrhea in dogs by disrupting the “good bacteria” normally present in the digestive system.

Fresh meat is converted into a meat meal by a third party using a cooking process. This process removes the water from the meat and allows pet food manufacturers to add meat meal as a dry ingredient. Meat meals are used in pet food to ensure a finished pet food kibble which is high in quality protein and more nutrient dense (since it takes 3 to 5 lbs of fresh meat to produce 1 pound of meal). In addition, meat meals have an increased shelf life as compared to fresh meat. Other manufacturers may use preservatives such as ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT on meat between slaughter and the processing plant, which may not be listed on a food's ingredient panel. At Petcurean, however, we ensure all of our meat meals are not preserved with ethoxyquin, BHA or BHT between slaughter and processing and require all of our suppliers and partners to use natural preservatives (Vitamin E). Petcurean only uses 'named' meat meals (such as chicken meal) in our foods as these meals are of higher quality protein source and are made only from muscle meats and bone. Alternative meat meal sources (by-product meals* and un-named meat meals**) are inferior sources of protein and are not used by Petcurean. *By-product meals (such as poultry-by-product meal) may include unwanted ingredients such as beaks and feathers. **Un-named meat meals (such as poultry-meal) may include meats from many different unknown animal sources."

It's important to slowly transition your pet to a new food so their system has a chance to adapt to the change. The transition period should be at minimum, ten days and could take upwards of two weeks, depending on your pet's sensitivity to change. Food transition steps On day one, introduce 10% new food / 90% old food. Keep the food at this ratio for two or more days. Next, increase the ratio to 20% new food / 80% old food for two or more days. Repeat increasing in increments of 10% until you're feeding 100% of the new food. If your pet experiences any kind of digestive upset during this time, try slowing down the process to let his/her digestive tract adjust to the new food. Some digestive upset can be common when introducing new foods. If you experience any vomiting and/or diarrhea, be sure to reduce the amount of new food the next time you feed and overall, slow the whole transition period down even more."

1,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,Water,"Water Essential to life, water accounts for between 60 to 70% of an adult pet’s body weight. While food may help meet some of your pet's water needs (dry food has up to 10% moisture, while canned food has up to 78% moisture), pets must have fresh clean water available to them at all times. A deficiency of water may have serious repercussions for pets. A 10% decrease in body water can cause serious illness, while a 15% loss can result in death."
2,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,Proteins,"Proteins Proteins are the basic building blocks for cells, tissues, organs, enzymes, hormones and antibodies, and are essential for growth, maintenance, reproduction and repair. Proteins can be obtained from a number of sources including animal-based meats such as chicken, lamb, turkey, beef, fish and eggs (which have complete amino acid profiles) and in vegetables, cereals and soy (but these are considered incomplete proteins). Please note: Do not give your pet raw eggs. Raw egg white contains avidin, an anti-vitamin that interferes with the metabolism of fats, glucose, amino acids and energy."
3,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,Fats,"Fats Fats are the most concentrated form of food energy, providing your pet with more than twice the energy of proteins or carbohydrates. Fats are essential in the structure of cells, needed for the production of some hormones, and are required for absorption and utilization of certain vitamins. Fats also provide insulation and protection for internal organs. A deficiency of essential fatty acids (such as linoleic acid) may result in reduced growth or increased skin problems."
4,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,Carbohydrates,"Carbohydrates Carbohydrates provide energy, play a vital role in the health of the intestine, and are important for reproduction. While there is no minimum carbohydrate requirement, there is a minimum glucose requirement necessary to supply energy to critical organs such as the brain. Fibers are kinds of carbohydrates that alter the bacterial population in the small intestine, which can help manage chronic diarrhea in dogs. For dogs to obtain the most benefit from fiber, the fiber source must be moderately fermentable. Moderately fermentable fibers—including beet pulp, which is commonly used in dog foods—are best to promote a healthy gut while avoiding the undesirable side effects of highly fermentable fibers, like flatulence and excess mucus. Other examples of moderately fermentable fibers include brans (corn, rice and wheat) and wheat middlings. Foods that are high in fiber are not good for dogs with high energy requirements, and who are young and growing."

Most vitamins cannot be synthesized in the body, and therefore are essential to obtain in the diet. Please note that when feeding your dog a complete and balanced diet, it is unnecessary to give a vitamin supplement unless a specific vitamin deficiency is diagnosed by a veterinarian. Due to over supplementation, poisoning due to excess vitamins (hypervitaminosis) is more common these days than vitamin deficiency (hypovitaminosis). Excess vitamin A may result in bone and joint pain, brittle bones and dry skin. Excess vitamin D may result in very dense bones, soft tissue calcification and kidney failure."

In general, minerals are most important as structural constituents of bones and teeth, for maintaining fluid balance and for their involvement in many metabolic reactions. Weaning and Feeding Your Puppy If you’re responsible caring for puppies in the first few months of their lives, you’ll need to be prepared to move them from a diet of mom’s milk to regular puppy food. This process of gradually reducing a puppy’s dependency on his mother’s milk, known as weaning, should generally begin between three and four weeks of age and is ideally completely by the time the puppy is seven to eight weeks.

7,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,When to Wean a Litter of Puppies,"When to Wean a Litter of Puppies Puppies receive complete nutrition from their mother’s milk for the first four weeks of life, so there is no need to feed them anything during that time. However, in the event that the mother dog is ill or doesn’t produce enough milk during these four weeks—or if the pups are found as orphans—it may be necessary to feed them commercial milk replacer. If you find yourself in this situation, contact your veterinarian for product and feeding recommendations. After that time, it’s best to let weaning be a gradual process that occurs over several weeks. This allows the mother dog to slowly dry up her milk supply and puppies need time to learn important behaviors from their mother and littermates, including how to interpret signs of dominance, inhibit their own biting habits and submit to more dominant dogs. Puppies generally begin eating puppy food around three to four weeks of age."
8,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,How to Wean a Litter of Puppies,"How to Wean a Litter of Puppies Start by separating the mother from her litter for a few hours at a time. This time apart will reduce the pups’ dependency on their mother’s milk and overall presence. While separated, introduce the puppies to eating from a pan. The amount of food, the frequency and length of separation can gradually be increased. As the puppies become independent and self-confident, they can spend more and more time away from their mother until they are completely weaned. Take your time. It can be frustrating if puppies don’t immediately take to the transition, but be patient—periodic setbacks are normal!"

This should be discussed with your veterinarian to ensure that the puppies are receiving adequate nutrition, and that the mother’s food intake is being adjusted properly when she is no longer nursing her litter."
10,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,Feeding Your Puppy During the Weaning Process,"Feeding Your Puppy During the Weaning Process While weaning, it’s a good idea to feed puppies the same high-quality puppy food they’ll eat throughout their entire growth period. Be sure to moisten the food with warm water (or puppy milk replacer) to create a soupy mix that’s appealing to their sensitive palates. Puppies often play with their food when it is first introduced, but they will quickly learn what to do with it! Start with small quantities, and gradually increase the amount of puppy food. By the time the pups are completely weaned at seven to eight weeks old, they should be eating their dry food consistently."
11,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,How Much Dry Food to Feed Your Puppy,"How Much Dry Food to Feed Your Puppy Puppies require up to twice the energy intake of adult dogs and, depending on the breed, will need to be fed a food that contains 25 to 30% protein. Remember, the adult size of a dog is determined genetically—not by how fast the animal grows. Do not overfeed in an attempt to accelerate a puppy’s growth rate. If they are allowed to overeat, puppies can consume too many calories, grow too rapidly and develop health problems. Small breeds often reach their adult body weight in nine to twelve months. As puppies, its okay to leave dry food out for small them to peck as they wish. But most medium-breed puppies and all large- or giant-breed pups can suffer from bone or joint problems if they eat too much during this stage and benefit most from controlled feeding. Feeding Your Adult Dog Adult dogs require sufficient nutrients to meet energy needs and to maintain and repair body tissues. The amount you feed your adult dog should be based on his or her size and energy output. Activity levels may vary dramatically between pets, and will play an important role in determining caloric intake. Expand to read more"
12,https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips,Dog Nutrition Tips | ASPCA,How Much to Feed Your Dog,"How Much to Feed Your Dog The amount you feed your adult dog should be based on his or her size and energy output. For example, an animal with a normal activity level should receive what we call “maintenance” energy. A pampered lap dog may require just 10% of that, while an active pet who exercises regularly outdoors may require maintenance plus 20 to 40%. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog’s ideal “maintenance” amount. Pet owners should always consult with their dog’s veterinarian to determine the best feeding schedule and types of foods for their pets. Outside factors, like the temperature, can contribute to how much your dog should eat. Since keeping warm and cool require extra energy expenditure, extreme hot or cold weather can also increase a dog’s energy needs. Talk to your pet’s veterinarian about what to do when the mercury dips or soars."

Since smaller dogs live longer and don't experience these age-related changes as early as bigger dogs, size is used to determine when it’s time to feed your canine a senior diet. A good guideline to follow is: Small breeds and dogs weighing less than 20 pounds—7 years of age Medium breeds and dogs weighing 21 to 50 pounds—7 years of age Large breeds and dogs weighing 51 to 90 pounds—6 years of age Giant breeds and dogs weighing 91 pounds or more—5 years of age"

It is important to feed older dogs diets that contain optimum levels of highly digestible protein to help maintain good muscle mass. Older dogs have been shown to progressively put on body fat in spite of consuming fewer calories. This change in body composition is inevitable and may be aggravated by either reduced energy expenditure or a change in metabolic rate. Either way, it is important to feed a diet with a lower caloric density to avoid weight gain, but with a normal protein level to help maintain muscle mass."

You should be able to feel the backbone and touch the ribs in an animal of healthy weight. If you cannot feel your pet’s ribs without pressing, there is too much fat. Also, you should see a noticeable waist between the back of the rib cage and the hips when looking at your pet from above.

Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat. Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine. You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily. Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet. Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.

But if she is very dirty or gets into something sticky or smelly, you may need to give her a bath. Follow these steps to ensure minimal stress and maximum efficiency. Expand to read more Schedule baths when your cat is at her most mellow. A play session with a cat dancer or other toy of choice can help tire out even the friskiest of felines.f For your own protection, we recommend trimming Fluffy’s claws before bathing. Give your cat a good brushing to remove any loose hair and mats. Gently place some cotton in her ears to keep the water out. Place a rubber bath mat in the sink or tub where you’ll be bathing your kitty so she doesn’t slip. Fill with three to four inches of lukewarm (not hot, please!) water. Use a hand-held spray hose to thoroughly wet your pet , taking care not to spray directly in her ears, eyes and nose. If you don’t have a spray hose, a plastic pitcher or unbreakable cup works great. Gently massage your pet with a solution of one part cat shampoo (human shampoo can dry out her skin) to five parts water , working from head to tail, in the direction of hair growth. Take care to avoid the face, ears and eyes. Thoroughly rinse the shampoo off your cat with a spray hose or pitcher; again, be sure the water is lukewarm. Take good care that all residue has been removed, as it can irritate the skin and act as a magnet for dirt. Use a washcloth to carefully wipe your pet’s face. Plain water is fine unless her face is very dirty—in which case, we recommend using an extra-diluted solution of shampoo, being very cautious around her ears and eyes. Wrap your cat in a large towel and dry her with it in a warm place , away from drafts. If your kitty doesn’t mind the noise, you can use a blow dryer—on the lowest heat setting. If your pet has long hair, you may need to carefully untangle her fur with a wide-toothed comb. Reward your cat with endless praise—and her favorite treat—for a successful bathing session. Brushing Your Cat Brushing your cat not only removes dirt, grease and dead hair from her coat, but it helps to remove skin flakes and stimulates blood circulation, improving the overall condition of her skin. One or two brushings per week will help kitty to keep her healthy glow—and you’ll find that regular sessions are especially beneficial when your cat ages and is no longer able to groom so meticulously on her own. Expand to read more Before brushing, check out the condition of your kitty’s coat . If it’s healthy, her hair will have a natural gloss and spring back under your hand when you touch it. There shouldn’t be any bald patches or signs of fleas and ticks, and her skin should be free of wounds and unusual bumps. For short - haired cats: With a metal comb, work the brush through your cat’s fur from head to tail to remove dirt and debris. Work along the lie of her fur, brushing in the direction the coat grows. Brush all over her body, including her chest and abdomen, concentrating on one section at a time to remove dead hair and tangles. A rubber brush can be especially effective for removing dead hair on cats with short fur. For long - haired cats: Long-haired cats who live indoors shed throughout the year and need grooming sessions every few days to remove dead hair and prevent tangles. Start with her abdomen and legs, gently combing the fur upward toward her head. Comb the neck fur upward, toward her chin. Make a part down the middle of her tail and gently brush out the fur on either side. You can sprinkle talcum powder over knots and gently use your fingers to tease them apart. If the knots don’t come out by hand, try using a mat-splitter. During your weekly grooming sessions, run your hands along your cat’s body, checking for wounds, bumps and hidden tangles. Check for ticks and flea dirt, black specks of dried blood left behind by fleas. Sneak a peek under her tail to check for feces attached to the fur that may need to be snipped away with scissors. It’s also important to check around your cat’s anus for tan, rice-sized objects—these may indicate the presence of tapeworm. Neglecting to brush your kitty’s coat can lead to painful tangles and a bellyful of hair. You’ll know if your cat is suffering from hairballs when he coughs them up onto the floor or expels them in his feces. If, despite regular brushing, your cat continues to suffer from hairballs, there are several remedies available. Please ask your vet to recommend a solution. Skin Problems The condition of your cat’s skin is an indication of her overall health. When a skin problem occurs, your cat may respond with excessive scratching, chewing and/or licking. A wide range of causes—from external parasites and allergies to seasonal changes and stress, or a combination of these—may be affecting your cat’s skin and should be investigated. Skin problems are one of the most common reasons pet parents seek veterinary care. Expand to read more Symptoms of Skin Problems in Cats Constant scratching, licking and chewing at the skin, especially around the head and neck Scabs Redness or inflammation Round, scaly patches on the face and paws Dry, flaky or otherwise irritated skin Hair loss, bald patches Hairballs Rashes Swellings, lumps or skin discoloration Drainage of blood or pus One of the following may be causing an abnormality with your cat’s skin and should be investigated: Ringworm: This highly contagious fungal infection can result in inflammation, scaly patches and hair loss. Lesions are most commonly seen on the head, ears and paws, but sometimes no signs are seen. You’ll want to have your veterinarian treat it immediately to prevent other pets and people in the household from becoming infected. Fleas: Not only do fleas irritate the skin, cats can have an allergic response when exposed to them. Symptoms commonly include excessive scratching, thinning of hair above the base of the tail, crusts and red, raised skin lesions. Some cats may also be sensitive to flea-treatment products; certain flea collars, for example, may cause redness and irritation around the neck. Other external parasites: Ear mites usually cause itching and redness around the ears, and a dark, coffee ground-like material can be seen in the ear canals. Lice can produce intense itching, and mange mites can cause severe flaking and scaling. Seasonal allergies: Your cat’s constant scratching may be due to her sensitivity to common allergens from trees, mold and grasses. Food allergies: Many foods (such as beef, milk, poultry and corn), fillers and colorings can be seen as foreign by your cat’s immune system and can lead to itching and rashes. Grooming products: Certain shampoos and grooming products can irritate your cat’s skin. Seasonal changes: Many cats, like people, get dry, flaky skin in the winter. Environmental factors: Contact with certain chemicals or fabrics can cause skin irritation, as can exposure to the sun or excessive cold. Bacterial or yeast infections: These infections most commonly follow the onset of another skin disorder. Tumors: A variety of benign and malignant skin growths can develop in cats. Stress: Anxiety may cause cats to excessively lick and chew, causing hair loss. You should visit your vet for an exam as soon as you notice any abnormality in your pet’s skin , such as excessive hair loss, flaking and scaling, redness and bald patches, or if your pet begins to excessively scratch, lick and/or bite areas on his fur. After obtaining a history and performing a thorough physical examination of your cat, your vet may perform some of the following diagnostic tests in order to find the cause of your cat’s symptoms: Skin scraping with findings evaluated under a microscope to check for mites ""Tape test"" to check for parasites Individual hair examination under a microscope Bacterial culture and sensitivity tests Skin biopsy Food and other allergy testing Blood tests to assess your cat’s overall health Microscopic evaluation of cells to establish if bacteria or yeast are present Which Cats Are Prone to Skin Problems? Because of the wide ranges of causes, cats of all ages and breeds are susceptible to issues involving skin. Young, elderly, immunocompromised and cats living in overcrowded, stressful environments may be more susceptible to skin problems than others. To Prevent Skin Problems Use natural, hypoallergenic soaps and shampoos recommended for use on cats. Brush your cat regularly to prevent matting of hair. Feed your cat a healthy, balanced food without fillers or artificial ingredients. Implement a flea-treatment program recommended by your veterinarian. Thoroughly clean and vacuum your home (and remember to always throw away the bag). Provide calm living conditions for your cat. Your vet may prescribe skin creams and/or oral medications to prevent skin problems. To Treat Skin Problems Ask your vet about the following treatments: Topical products, including shampoos, dips and sprays, to prevent and treat parasites A balanced diet to help maintain healthy skin and coat Antibiotic or antifungal medications A dietary supplement containing essential fatty acids Corticosteroids and antihistamines may be prescribed to control itching. Hypoallergenic diet for food allergies Shedding Shedding is a cat’s natural process of losing dead hair. Indoor cats can shed all year-round. Regularly grooming your cat and vacuuming hair from your house should minimize the inconvenience of shedding. However, if you see bald patches in your cat’s fur or notice a significant loss of hair, the underlying cause may be a health-related problem and should be investigated by a veterinarian. Expand to read more A variety of medical, dietary and stress-related issues can cause your cat to lose more hair than is normal. If you notice he’s losing an excessive amount of hair or has bald patches, please consult your veterinarian immediately. Your cat may be suffering from one of the following health issues: Allergies Ringworm Bacterial infection Fleas Hormonal imbalance such as hyperthyroidism Poor diet Stress Certain medications Pregnancy or lactation Sunburn If your cat obsessively licks, bites or scratches, OR if he’s losing patches of hair or stops to scratch or bite the same few spots persistently, then it’s important you take him in for a veterinary exam. There may be a medical, dietary or stress-related issue that needs immediate attention. If your cat sheds a lot and your veterinarian has determined that there is no underlying medical cause, there are a few things you can do to minimize his hair loss: Feed him a healthy, balanced diet. Groom him regularly. Examine your cat’s skin and coat during your grooming sessions. Checking for hair loss, redness, bumps, cuts, fleas, ticks or other parasites will be a fast way to determine whether you need to go the vet to solve your pet’s shedding. If your cat’s shedding is normal, the worst you may end up with is a hairy wardrobe and home—your cat, however, may suffer from hairballs if she isn’t groomed regularly. If her shedding is due to an underlying medical cause, including allergies, parasites, infections or disease, her health may continue to worsen if you don’t seek veterinary care. Additionally, cats who are not groomed appropriately can become matted—this is especially true for long-haired cats. Matted hair can be painful and lead to underlying skin problems."

Monitoring your kitty’s ears once per week for wax, debris and infection will help those sensitive sonar detectors stay perky and alert to your every move. Expand to read more Outer Ear Check A healthy feline ear flap, or pinna, has a layer of hair on its outer surface with no bald spots, and its inner surface is clean and light pink. If you see any discharge, redness or swelling, your cat’s ears should be checked by a veterinarian. Inner Ear Exam Bring kitty into a quiet room where there are no other pets. Gently fold back each ear and look down into the canal. Healthy inner ears will be pale pink in color, carry no debris or odor and will have minimal if no earwax. If you find that your cat’s ears are caked with wax or you detect an odor, please bring her in for a veterinary exam. Ear Cleaning 101 Place a little bit of liquid ear cleaner (ask your vet for a recommendation) onto a clean cotton ball or piece of gauze. Fold kitty’s ear back gently and wipe away any debris or earwax that you can see on the underside of her ear. Lift away the dirt and wax rather than rubbing it into the ear. And do not attempt to clean the canal—probing inside of your cat’s ear can cause trauma or infection. Signs of Ear Problems Watch for the following signs that may indicate your cat’s ears should be checked by a veterinarian. Persistent scratching and pawing of the ear area Sensitivity to touch Head tilting or shaking Loss of balance and disorientation Redness or swelling of the ear flap or canal Unpleasant odor Black or yellowish discharge Accumulation of dark brown wax Hearing loss Bleeding Know Your Ear Disorders Ear mites are common parasites that are highly contagious among pets. Telltale signs include excessive itching of the ears and debris that resembles coffee grounds. Ear infections are usually caused by bacteria, yeast or foreign debris caught in the ear canal. Treatment should be sought immediately as ear infections can cause considerable discomfort and may indicate allergies, hormonal abnormalities or hereditary disease. Blood blisters (hematoma) are the result of blood accumulation in the ear flap. They’re often caused by infection, ear mites, fleas or trapped debris that causes your cat to scratch her ears or shake her head excessively."

Aside from causing pain, unhealthy substances that stick to her feet may end up on her tongue during grooming. Once each day, give your cat’s paws a gentle wipe with a damp cloth, checking between her toes and around the paw pads. Keeping your floors and other surfaces free of debris and household chemicals will go a long way to help keep your cat’s feet clean. Cats are natural explorers who sometimes get into foreign places. Check your cat’s paws regularly for any cuts, sores, splinters or swellings . Remove splinters or debris gently with tweezers and clean any small cuts. If you notice any blood, pus or an unusual odor, please take your cat to the vet to check for infection. Long-haired kitties may have hair sprouting in between their toes. If this irritates your cat (you’ll know if she licks at the hair obsessively), trim them gently with a small pair of rounded scissors. Be wary of your kitty’s sensitive paw pads. In hot and cold weather, moisturize them with a vet-recommended product and try to avoid letting your cat’s feet touch freezing patios, hot sidewalks or other uncomfortable surfaces. If you notice your cat obsessively cleaning her paws, limping or favoring one leg, please investigate —she might require veterinary attention. Nail Care Does your kitty disappear when the clippers come out? Do you have to wrap her in a towel to give her a manicure? Follow these steps to help your cat relax while you trim. Expand to read more Choose a chair in a quiet room where you can comfortably sit your cat on your lap. Get her when she’s relaxed and even sleepy, such as in her groggy, after-meal state. Take care that she isn’t able to spy any birds, wild animals or action outside nearby windows—and make sure no other pets are around. Gently take one of your cat’s paws between your fingers and massage for no longer than three seconds. If your cat pulls her paw away, don’t squeeze or pinch, just follow her gesture, keeping in gentle contact. When she’s still again, give her pad a little press so that the nail extends out, then release her paw and immediately give her a treat. Do this every other day on a different toe until you’ve gotten to know all ten. Your cat should be at ease with the sound of the clippers before you attempt to trim her nails. Sit her on your lap, put a piece of uncooked spaghetti into the clippers and hold them near your cat. (If she sniffs the clippers, set a treat on top of them for her to eat.) Next, while massaging one of your cat’s toes, gently press her toe pad. When the nail extends, clip the spaghetti with the clippers while still holding your cat’s paw gently. Now release her toe and quickly give her a treat. The pink part of a cat’s nail, called the quick, is where the nerves and blood vessels are. Do NOT cut this sensitive area. Snip only the white part of the claw. It’s better to be cautious and cut less of the nail rather than risk cutting this area. If you do accidentally cut the quick, any bleeding can be stopped with a styptic powder or stick. It’s a good idea to keep it nearby while you trim. With your cat in your lap facing away from you, take one of her toes in your hand, massage and press the pad until the nail extends. Now trim only the sharp tip of one nail, release your cat’s toe and quickly give her a treat. If your cat didn’t notice, clip another nail, but don’t trim more than two claws in one sitting until your cat is comfortable. Then, reward her with a special treat. A nail-trimming every ten days to two weeks is recommended. If your cat refuses to let you clip her claws, ask your vet or a groomer for help. If your cat resists, don’t raise your voice or punish her. Never attempt a clipping when your cat is agitated or you’re upset. And don’t rush—you may cut into the quick. Don’t try to trim all of your cat’s claws at one time. Do NOT declaw your cat. This surgery involves amputating the end of a cat’s toes and is highly discouraged by the ASPCA. Instead, trim regularly, provide your cat with appropriate scratching posts and ask your veterinarian about soft plastic covers for your cat’s claws."

Damage to the tongue, teeth, palate and gums can lead to many health risks for felines, but these can be prevented with regular home check-ups and good old-fashioned brushings. Expand to read more If your kitty’s mouth has an abnormally strong odor, he may have digestive problems or a gum condition such as gingivitis, and should be examined by a vet. With your cat facing you, gently push back his lips and take a look. The gums should be firm and pink, not white or red, and should show no signs of swelling. The teeth should be clean and free of any brownish tartar, and none should be loose or broken. Watch for any of the following signs that could indicate problems in your cat’s mouth: Dark red line along the gums Red and swollen gums Ulcers on gums or tongue Loose teeth Pus Difficulty chewing food Excessive drooling Excessive pawing at the mouth area At any sign of gum inflammation, you should take your cat in for a veterinary exam. If left untreated, gum disease can develop, possibly leading to tooth loss or inability to eat Inflammation may also point to an internal problem like kidney disease or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause a buildup on a cat’s teeth. This can harden into tartar, possibly causing gingivitis, receding gums and tooth loss. All you’ll need to brush your cat’s teeth are cotton swabs and a small toothbrush and tube of toothpaste formulated for felines. You can also use salt and water. Ask your vet to suggest the brushing supplies that he trusts, and be sure never to use toothpaste designed for people—the ingredients can be unhealthy for your cat. Brush your cat’s teeth at home by following these simple steps: First get your cat used to the idea of having her teeth brushed. Start by gently massaging her gums with your fingers or touching a cotton swab to them. After a few sessions, put a little bit of cat-formulated toothpaste on her lips to get her used to the taste. Introduce a toothbrush designed especially for cats —it will be smaller than human toothbrushes and have softer bristles. Toothbrushes that you can wear over your finger are also available and allow you to give a nice massage to your cat’s gums. Apply the toothpaste to her teeth for a gentle brushing. Chew toys can satisfy your cat’s natural desire to chomp, while making her teeth strong. Gnawing on a chew toy can also help floss your cat’s teeth, massage her gums and scrape away soft tartar. If your cat suffers from any of the symptoms mentioned below, please see the vet right away: Gingivitis: This inflammation of the gums is mainly seen in older cats. It may start as a dark red line bordering on the teeth. If left untreated, gums may become sore and ulceration may occur. This may be a sign of FIV or other infection. Periodontitis: If gingivitis invades the tooth socket, the tooth may become loose and an abscess may form. Stomatitis : This inflammation of the mouth lining may result from a foreign body in the mouth, a viral disease or dental problems. The cat will have difficulty eating and the inside of the mouth will appear red. Rodent Ulcer: A slowly enlarging sore or swelling on the upper lip. Salivary Cyst: If salivary glands or ducts that carry saliva to the mouth become blocked, a cyst may form under the tongue. Mouth Ulcers: Ulcers on a cat’s tongue and gums are sometimes caused by feline respiratory or kidney disease."

Here are few simple tips to keep your kitty’s eyes bright and healthy. Expand to read more Face your cat in a brightly lit area and look her in the eyes. They should be clear and bright, and the area around the eyeball should be white. Her pupils should be equal in size. Roll down your kitty’s eyelid gently with your thumb and take a look at the lid’s lining. It should be pink, not red or white. Wipe away any crusty gunk from your cat’s eyes with a damp cotton ball. Always wipe away from the corner of the eye, and use a fresh cotton ball for each eye. Snip away any long hairs that could be blocking her vision or poking her eyes. Try not to use eye washes or eye drops unless they’ve been prescribed by your vet. How can you tell if there is something wrong with one or both of your cat’s eyes? Look out for the following: Discharge Watering Red or white eyelid linings Crusty gunk in the corners of the eye Tear-stained fur Closed eye(s) Cloudiness or change in eye color Visible third eyelid Certain body language will also alert you to possible eye distress. If your cat is constantly squinting or pawing at her eye area, give her eyes a good inspection. If you find any of the above symptoms, you should immediately call your vet. The following eye-related disorders are commonly seen in cats: Conjunctivitis: One or both of your cat’s eyes will look red and swollen, and there may be discharge. Third eyelid protrusion: If the third eyelid becomes visible or crosses your cat’s eye, he may have a wound or may be suffering from diarrhea, worms or a virus. Keratitis: If your cat’s cornea becomes inflamed, the eye will look cloudy and watery. Cataracts: This opacity on the eye is often seen in elderly and diabetic cats. Glaucoma: The cornea becomes cloudy and the eye enlarges due to an increased pressure in the eyeball. Bulging eye: Bulging can occur because of accident or trauma or an eye tumor. Retinal disease: Partial or total vision loss can happen when light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye degenerate. Watery eyes: The fur around your cat’s eyes may be stained with tears because of blocked tear ducts or an overproduction of tears. Many feline eye disorders can be treated with vet-prescribed drops or ointments—your vet will show you how to apply eye and ear drops at home. The best way to prevent eye conditions is to make sure your cat gets all her vaccinations and has thorough check-ups. Please examine her eyes regularly and consult a vet if you find any abnormalities. Eye conditions that are left untreated can lead to impaired sight or even blindness."

Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid for cats. Arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, is also essential for cats for the maintenance of the skin and coat, for kidney function and for reproduction. Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids play a vital role in healing inflammation. Replacing some omega-6 with omega-3 fatty acids can lessen an inflammatory reaction—whether it is in the skin (due to allergies), the joints (from arthritis), the intestines (from inflammatory bowel disease) or even in the kidneys (from progressive renal failure)."

Doing so keeps diseases, fungi, insect eggs, and weed seeds from being unwittingly spread around the garden. Cleaning also extends the life of a tool by removing moisture-laden, rust enhancing soil from steel surfaces. For tools with a keen edge, a good cleaning keeps rust from eating the edge away.  Spades, rakes, hoes, trowels, and any other tools that come into contact with soil should be hosed off with water after each use. With the garden hose nozzle adjusted for maximum pressure, average garden soil washes away easily. To remove heavy clay soil , some scrubbing with a hard bristle brush also may be necessary. After washing any tool, dry it with a cotton rag before putting it away.  Tools that don’t come in contact with soil, particularly those with sharpened edges like axes, pruning shears, and knives, should be wiped down with a thick, rough cotton cloth to remove any gums and saps from their blades. When working on pitch-producing plants like conifers, dampen the cloth with a little paint thinner before wiping. In all cases, once dirt and residue are removed, dry the tool with a clean cotton rag.   End Slice  START: Slice drupal-slice  "

In fact, as a general rule, the better the grade of steel used, the more vulnerable it is to rusting. So, considering the high cost of quality gardening tools, it just makes sense to keep rusting to a minimum.  Motor oil is an inexpensive and effective rust preventer. When applied to steel surfaces, the oil insulates the steel and prevents it from oxidizing. To thin the oil out and make it easier to work with and to better coat both porous and smooth steel surfaces, I mix one quart of nondetergent 30W motor oil (any brand will do) with a pint of kerosene or lamp oil. This 2:1 ratio of oil to kerosene can either then be wiped onto the steel surface with a clean cotton rag or sprayed on to metal surfaces—a recycled household-cleaner spray bottle works for me. Store the mixture away from heat sources and dispose of it as you would any motor oil.  Whichever way the oil is applied, keep the coating thin so it won’t drip off the tool head and onto the floor. Because oil is organically based and breaks down rapidly in soil, you don’t have to worry about this small amount of oil adversely affecting your soils.    End Slice  START: Slice drupal-slice "

I use a sheet of 80-grit sandpaper to remove light coatings of rust. For a slightly heavier coat, a stiff wire brush can be effective. But, when rust has turned a steel surface rough, like the texture of medium-grit sandpaper, a heavy-handed approach is needed. On badly pitted steel surfaces like those on tools you find at yard sales, the quickest and most sensible option is an electric drill with a wirebrush attachment. End Slice  START: Slice drupal-slice   Before taking any kind of wire brush to a tool, always put on a pair of safety glasses. The rust particles or the wire bristles can fly off at high speeds and in unpredictable directions.  Once I’ve removed as much rust as possible, I then apply a coat of my oil mixture to the newly exposed steel to stop the oxidation process in its tracks and keep in check the almost-invisible residual rust that I couldn’t remove.

The key to successful sharpening is keeping the tool steady and the file at the proper angle.  Sharpen pruning blades and knives by sliding an oiled honing stone in one direction across the tool’s beveled edge.   Sharpening tools is a slightly more complicated procedure than removing rust. Some tools like shovels, axes, hoes, and trowels are best sharpened with a hand file, while other tools like pruning shears and knives call for a honing stone. Depending on how dull an edge is, some tools may require a session with a high-speed grinding stone.  The tools needed for basic sharpening are neither expensive nor complicated. The most basic sharpening tool is an 8-inch-long mill file with a bastard cut (photo below, left), which you can purchase at any hardware store for about $8. When sharpening a tool with a mill file, work by drawing the cutting teeth in one direction over the edge being sharpened. For best results, hold the tool steady in a clamp, vise, or other bracing system, keeping the file at an angle from the plane of the tool’s working surface as you push it along the edge you are sharpening. And since sharpening edges with a mill file requires two hands, get one that has a handle on one end. This makes it easier to maneuver and get a good edge.  For pruning shears and knives, it’s possible to get good results with any of the diamond, ceramic, or high-carbon steel honing devices that are on the market. However, my experience with honing knives and pruning shears is confined to oil stones, which I find easy to use. When sharpening a blade on a stone, simply slide the blade over the flat surface of the stone in one direction until you reach the desired sharpness. No matter which device you choose to sharpen your cutting blades, it should come with directions for use.   End Slice   "

To make tools razor sharp, sharpen at a low angle with a long bevel (top); heavier, blunter tools are sharpened at a wider angle with a short bevel (bottom). Photo/Illustration: Kim Jaeckel  How sharp you make your tools is a matter of personal taste. I like my shovels to be sharp enough to cut through minor roots, but with my rocky soil, I won’t redress an edge to razor sharpness every five minutes. On the other hand, when I’m trimming back my lilacs, a razor-edged pair of pruning shears makes the job quick and easy.  A good guideline to use when sharpening is to follow the bevel already on the tool’s blade. Recommended sharpening angles range from 10 to 45 degrees depending on the tool and its use. In general, the angle of sharpness determines the length of the blade’s beveled edge, so it’s easy to tell by looking at a blade the angle to use as a guideline when sharpening.  For example, blades sharpened at low angles have relatively wide bevels. Knives and pruning shears, tools that need finer edges for cutting, should be sharpened to between a 10- to 25-degree angle. Tools used for heavy-duty chores that dull the blades quickly, like hoes, shovels, and mattocks, only need to be sharpened to a 30- to 35-degree angle. The bevel on these blades is relatively short (illustration, below). Understanding this relationship is the key to successful sharpening.    START: Slice drupal-slice  "

Lawn-mower blades and axes that take a lot of abuse deserve an annual trip to a grinder.  Since the grinding process removes metal quickly, only the most battered tools are candidates for regular grinding. Tools like lawn-mower blades and grub axes usually merit an annual trip to my grinder. An electric bench grinder is the best way to retrieve a keen edge because it has an adjustable tool-rest platform that allows for more exacting edges.  With a grinding wheel turning at several thousand rpm, the chances of overheating the steel are high. Overheated steel will lose its temper, which means its hardness becomes compromised and the tool will never be able to hold a sharpened edge for very long. So during grinding it’s very important to keep the tool from getting too hot, preferably keeping the surface cool enough to touch. Periodically immersing it in water is the standard cooling procedure.  High-speed grinding should be done with caution. Even with the extra eye shields provided on some machines, you should always wear safety glasses when grinding tools. A bench grinder/buffer can be purchased for around $40. You can also do some basic touch-up grinding with a small grinding wheel (less than $10) made to fit an electric drill.   End Slice  START: Slice drupal-slice  "

It’s important to store your clean, oiled, and sharpened tools properly. I organize my tools according to when and where I use them. Weeding tools are near the door closest to the garden; cutting and pruning tools are near the door closest to the shrubs and woods. And I return them all to the same spot when I’m finished to save time looking for tools when it’s time to work.  Hanging your tools by their handles on a storage shed or garage wall not only keeps them out of the way but also prevents damage to sharpened edges. A 10-penny finish nail driven into a handy two-by-four is the easiest way to keep tools aloft. I drill 1/4-inch holes through the handles of my axes, shovels, hoes, rakes, and other long-handled tools so I can hang them on the nails. I like to keep the business end of the tool hanging toward the floor so when I pull the tool off its nail, it won’t swing down and hit something or someone.  I’ve seen the light—or at least have become more aware of my own dimness— as far as tool maintenance is concerned. Without being too compulsive about it, I now clean, sharpen, and repair all my gardening tools, even if they are only being set aside for a couple of weeks.    End Slice"

While this fall lawn fertilizer dose is important, an application at the end of October or early November is essential. At that time, apply a fertilizer with a formula of 13-25-12.

In my opinion, all trees and shrubs need fertilizer because most of them are located in mulch beds that use nitrogen as they decompose. In addition, every fall, we rake leaves off these beds, depriving plants of the nutrients that decomposing leaves would traditionally release. I recommend applying one to three pounds of slow-release nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of bed and cultivating lightly to compensate. (To figure out the exact amount of fertilizer you’ll need, calculate the square footage of your beds and consult with your local garden center.) I prefer fertilizing trees in late September and early October to promote root growth. These nutrients will still be in the soil come spring when plants start to grow. If you have a tree or shrub that does not flower well, a dose of super phosphate will help promote flower growth. However, if the plant is not located in the right spot, all the superphosphate in the world won’t make it flower."

A high amount of carbs might endanger your feline’s health and cause obesity and diabetes  The caloric value of dry food is significantly larger than that of other types of cat food, which can be beneficial if your cat should put on some weight, but it might lead to overfeeding in other cases  The lack of moisture in dry food can lead to dehydration and urinary problems. If you want to include dry food in your kitty’s diet, you can pour some water or chicken broth over it, but don’t forget to serve a wet meal every now and then   In conclusion, most commercial dry foods aren’t an ideal cat food option, and if you feed it to your cat, do it in moderation.

Wet food may be a better choice for a healthy and happy kitty because:   It has a super high water content  Your feline can enjoy a larger portion while not overeating because of the lower caloric value  The texture can be appealing to your cat  Cat food companies often offer a line of therapeutic wet food specially designed for cats with particular health conditions, such as allergies, kidney problems, digestive issues, etc.   The main downside of wet food is that it’s generally more expensive than dry cat food, but it is an investment in your feline’s well-being for the long term.   Mom, are you pawsitive you emptied the entire tin? Image (c) Untamed  The good, the bad, and the ugly of cat food  All commercial cat food items are not the same, and it’s up to you to choose which products will work for your feline. Let’s look at the pros and cons of the cat food available across stores:      The good    The bad    The ugly       Pre-sized meals are easy to serve  You will spend less money on commercial cat food than if you were to cook food for your feline yourself  You have plenty of options to choose from until you find the one that works for your kitty      Most commercial cat food isn’t as nutritional as it claims to be  Some brands offer dry and wet food packed with fillers like animal derivatives and grains      Vegetable derivatives  Artificial flavouring and colouring  Preservatives  Ingredients can include meats that aren’t allowed for human consumption and have been contaminated with metals, chemicals, and other contaminants       When buying commercial cat food, go for products that have a high protein content (above 50%) and a minimum amount of fats. Avoid the ones that go overboard with fillers like animal derivatives, grains, sugar, or vegetable proteins.   Sharing is caring—human foods that cats can handle   A snack every now and then won’t harm your kitty, provided you give them small portions. You can use many items from your own pantry to treat your feline—or if their pleading eyes while you eat are the problem, you can share some of your food without remorse.  Here are some human foods your cat can enjoy:      Fruit    Veggies    Grain       Blueberries  Melon  Watermelon  Strawberries  Bananas  Blackberries  Raspberries  Mangos  Pineapples      Carrots (cooked or steamed)  Pumpkin  Squash  Cucumber  Peas  Tomatoes  Cauliflower  Broccoli      Oatmeal  Corn  Millet  Couscous       Before sharing these foods with your cat, keep in mind that:   These are only snacks and not the main ingredients of a healthy cat diet, so you should offer them to your cat sparingly and in small quantities  Treats should make up only 2% of your cat’s diet  Diabetic cats should never eat fruit  You need to check up on your feline to see if they’re having a hard time digesting a snack they're eating for the first time    Cat diet no-nos   Some of the cat diet no-nos that could seriously harm your feline are:    Alcohol —it leads to digestive issues, choking, coma, and death    Chocolate and coffee —these contain toxins theobromine and caffeine that can cause severe problems and even death    Citrus fruits —these are very harsh for a cat's stomach because of the citric acid they contain (they can cause vomiting , diarrhoea , and an upset stomach)    Coconut flesh and water —these cause digestive problems     Fat trimmings —this lead to severe digestive issues and inflammation of the pancreas    Garlic, onions, leeks, shallots, chives, and scallions —these veggies cause gastrointestinal problems and damage to erythrocytes (red blood cells)    Grapes and raisins —they can lead to kidney damage and their eventual failure    Milk and cheese (in large amounts) —cause digestive issues such as diarrhoea, constipation, and vomiting, especially in lactose intolerant cats    Mushrooms —they usually lead to drooling, digestive problems, tearing, and liver damage    Nuts —they cause digestive issues and inflammation of the pancreas (often accompanied by inflammation of the liver and intestine)     Raw bread dough with yeast —yeast leads to bloating and twisting of the spleen    Salt (in large amounts) —salt leads to tremors, seizures, digestive issues, dehydration, and even death in cats    Seeds and skin of cherries, plums, apples, or pears —these cause respiratory problems and shock because of the cyanide compound    Small and uncooked bones —bone splinters can lead to choking or rupture to your feline’s organs    Xylitol (sugar-free food sweetener) —it leads to vomiting, lethargy, and liver failure     Signs your furry friend isn’t feeling feline  An unbalanced diet can affect your cat in different ways. Some warning signs include:   Lethargy  Fever  Vomiting  Inconsistent appetite  Sudden increase or decrease in water intake  Low energy  Constipation or diarrhoea  Bland and rough coat  Dull eyes   Sudden weight loss or gain    If you notice any out-of-the-ordinary behaviour, consider taking your cat to the vet. Nutrient deficiency can cause severe health problems, such as:   Anaemia  Cataract  Skin, bone, and eye deformation  Muscular dystrophy  Nutrient malabsorption  Slow or no growth  Fatty liver   Fussy and picky eaters  Is your cat refusing to eat ? Fussy and picky eaters can give us a hard time, but we love them, and that’s why we want to make sure they eat well. If your demanding feline is rejecting food, the reasons could be:   Sudden change in:   Type of food  Food brand  The flavour—if your feline is used to chicken, switching to fish may prove to be challenging  Way of serving food—since we love our feline friends so much, we tend to spoil them. If you had a particular way of preparing their food, you might have to stick to it (this can include heating the meal, cutting the food in a specific way, adding water to dry food, and similar)   The food bowl being dirty  Stale food  Hot weather  A snack your cat caught before mealtime   If you tried your best to fix the issues mentioned above, but your feline still isn’t eating, they might be having health problems and require veterinary assistance.  Tips on how to find the purrfect meal size  Depending on your furry friend’s age, size, and activity, they need 40–45 calories per kilo of healthy body weight. You can feed your adult and senior felines once or twice a day, but in some cases, that might not be the best approach. If your cat tends to wake you up at night seeming hungry, splitting a daily food portion into multiple small meals may be better than adding more meals and overfeeding them.  Other benefits of smaller portions include:   Less bloating  Better digestion  Better weight management  Increased energy and activity    Are you ready for a pawsitive change in your cat’s diet ?   Many cat parents introduce a new brand or type of food abruptly, which is a shock for their furballs.  Luckily, there is a way to ease your feline’s transition from one food to another, and we’ll show you how. Before we get started, keep in mind that this process needs to last for at least one week. Ideally, the introduction period should last for two weeks because if you allow more time for your cat to adjust, you’re more likely to succeed.  You want to introduce the new food gradually. Start by making it approximately 20% of the entire meal or even 10% if you’re going for a steadier pace. After that, you will increase the percentage of the new food:   Every 2–3 days by 10% if the process will last two weeks  Every day by 20% if you’re doing it for one week   If you opt for the quicker method, check up on your kitty and their bowl to see their reaction to the change. An adverse reaction of your feline might require you to slow down the process.

1,https://www.thedodo.com/dodowell/cat-grooming,Cat Grooming 101: How To Groom A Cat - DodoWell - The Dodo,Brushing your cat,"Brushing your cat All cats should be brushed, no matter their coat length (except for hairless cats, of course). And this is the easiest of all grooming tasks to do at home. “I recommend regular brushing for every cat,” Matthes said. “5 to 10 minutes daily is ideal, but [brush] at least three times a week. Start early in life, make it fun and a time for bonding. Treats are always welcome.” It’s important to find the best cat brush for your cat’s specific coat. “Many short-haired cats tend to be heavy shedders, and brushes like the Zoom Groom are gentle on skin and can attract a lot of dead hair,” Paolillo said. “For short-haired kitties, I love to use the Furminator ,” Matthes said. “It works well with removing their loose coat.” And for long-haired cats who need more consistent brushing, combs are most effective. “Smaller combs are great for around their head, legs and paws. Whereas large, metal combs are a better choice for the body, chest, legs, tail and belly,” Paolillo said. Matthes added that her favorite comb for long-haired cats is a greyhound comb . “[It] takes care of mats before they become too big to remove.” Soft, natural bristle brushes aren’t super effective at removing dead hair, but they can offer a relaxing massage for cats, so you can use one after a more in-depth brush. And slicker brushes, Matthes noted, are OK when used lightly. “Not my favorite tool … it can cause injury if used on older, thin-skinned kitties.” Always brush in the direction of hair growth and brush in short strokes, stopping if you hit a tangle or mat. Less severe mats can be picked apart with your fingers or combed using a metal comb with even shorter strokes. “Small mats, under the size of a quarter, are usually more likely to be removed by combing,” Paolillo said. “But larger, severe or widespread matting will require a professional to use clippers safely. There are also occasions where cats cannot be shaved or have mats removed safely without being sedated by their veterinarian. A professional cat groomer can evaluate your cat to let you know your best options.” This is why sticking to a regular grooming routine is so important, especially for mat-prone cats. “Combing your cats, both long-haired and short-haired, is something that can be incorporated into the cat’s regular routine,” Paolillo said. “I recommend to my clients to put their comb next to the TV remote. While your cat sits with you watching TV, get in the habit of combing sections of their body throughout the week. High-risk areas that can mat include the base of the tail, the chest, the armpits, belly and the back of the rear legs. If you are noticing knots or mats on their back or sides, then most likely there are a lot more mats on the underside.”"
2,https://www.thedodo.com/dodowell/cat-grooming,Cat Grooming 101: How To Groom A Cat - DodoWell - The Dodo,Trimming your cat's nails,"Trimming your cat's nails Keeping your cat’s nails trimmed is a much more humane way to keep scratching and furniture destruction at a minimum compared to declawing. And regular nail trims are often necessary for senior cats with lower activity levels — sometimes their claws can actually grow into their pads if not properly maintained. “ [Cat] nail trims can be done at home, especially if starting as young as possible with the cat,” Paolillo said. “I prefer small dog nail trimmers, but there are several different nail trimmer styles, so you can choose what feels the most comfortable.” There are guillotine-style nail trimmers, scissor-style trimmers and some cat parents even prefer human fingernail clippers. Dr. Megan Conrad, a veterinarian who works with telehealth pet care company Hello Ralphie , said she likes the scissor style as they’re the easiest to use, especially for those who are just starting out with at-home nail trimming. Having styptic powder or cornstarch on hand, too, is important just in case you clip your cat’s quick and she starts bleeding. “If you've never trimmed your cat's nails before, the key thing to remember is to start slowly, and start while your cat's mood is calm,” Dr. Conrad told The Dodo, adding that you should let your cat get used to the feeling of having her toes touched first. “Try gently squeezing a toe (push the pad and top of the toe) to extend the nail, then quickly release it. Do this for a few toes, take a break for a while and do another session later.” Then, when it’s time to trim, extend the claw and only cut the curved, pointed tip above the pink quick line “Your goal is to cut only the pointed end of the nail, without cutting into the area of the quick, to avoid bleeding,” Dr. Conrad said. Give your cat plenty of breaks and treats during her nail trim session, and if she’s squirmy, focus on clipping her front nails, as these are the ones that can cause the most damage, and leave her back feet for later."
3,https://www.thedodo.com/dodowell/cat-grooming,Cat Grooming 101: How To Groom A Cat - DodoWell - The Dodo,Bathing your cat,"Bathing your cat The first thing you should ask yourself before getting ready to bathe your cat is if your cat even needs to be bathed at all . More often than not, she probably doesn’t. “Not all cats need to be bathed,” Matthes said. “Some specific breeds should be bathed, specifically hairless cats because of oil buildup and [for] skincare, as well as older cats [who] may have an oily coat and a buildup of dander due to medical reasons or lack of self-grooming.” Other situations that may require giving your cat a bath include if your cat gets into something toxic, sticky or smelly, or if she has a health issue that must be treated with regular bathing. Always consult your vet first if you suspect your cat has a skin issue, pests or if you’ve noticed she’s not grooming herself. But, if your cat does need to have a bath, The Dodo explained how to bathe a cat without making her hate you (hopefully!). You’ll need a bit of patience, the right shampoo and lots of cat treats. Cat grooming wipes are also an excellent alternative to a full-on bath. These are great if your cat got into something dusty or dirty that doesn’t really require her to get shampooed."
4,https://www.thedodo.com/dodowell/cat-grooming,Cat Grooming 101: How To Groom A Cat - DodoWell - The Dodo,Cleaning your cat's ears,"Cleaning your cat’s ears is another task that depends on your cat’s current condition and doesn’t need to be done regularly. “If the cat’s ears are free of wax, debris and any redness, then cleaning at home isn’t as necessary,” Paolillo said. “However, some need more cleaning than others.” Matthes suggested a simple, non-invasive cleaning twice a month or so can be done if you notice your cat’s ears getting a bit dirty. “You can purchase an ear cleaner for cats and put it on a cotton ball … Wipe what you can see. Not too hard. Then back it up with a dry cotton ball.” Never clean inside your cat’s ear canal, because you could end up doing some damage. Reserve your cleaning for just around the outer ear. “If you see buildup in a shorter time, redness, frequent scratching or head shaking, I would definitely recommend a vet visit to rule out infection or ear mites,” Matthes said. It should be noted that some cats simply will not tolerate being groomed at home. And sometimes a cat parent can’t commit to a regular grooming schedule. Both situations are OK, but you’ll need to find an alternative solution to at-home grooming. “Getting on a regular schedule with a professional cat groomer can prevent a lot of issues,” Paolillo said. “Many cats are much more tolerant of the bath and blow dry process when done by a trained pro.” Be patient and gentle with your cat, and hopefully she’ll warm up to the idea of grooming and realize that, although she does a great job on her own, every little bit helps.

1,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,"Aphids (Greenfly, Blackfly)","Aphids (Greenfly, Blackfly)    Appearance: Aphids are extremely common and can significantly impact on plant growth. They have tiny soft pear-shaped bodies. There are hundreds of species, but the most commonly known can be grouped as greenfly or blackfly – although equally may be orange, brown, or pink in colour. You may spot them clustered on the stem of soft shoots – look under leaves in particular – or may find a sticky substance on your plants that gives away aphids have been there sucking at the sap. Ants farm aphids and if you see ants running up and down the stems it is often a sign there are aphids.  Key Signs of Aphid Damage: Look for leaves that are curling, yellowing, or misshapen. The presence of Honeydew (a clear, sticky substance, often accompanied by a black sooty coating) is another good indicator of aphids.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Aphids eat a huge variety of plants, both outdoor, and in the greenhouse. They prefer soft, new shoots.  Ways to Tackle: A number of beneficial insects, including ladybirds, lacewing larvae and hoverflies, are natural predators of aphids so a good garden ecosystem will help with control. If there are not too many, you can also squash them. If your plant has a real infestation, gently shake the plant so the aphids fall off. They can also be rinsed off with a light solution of washing up liquid. "
2,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Whitefly,"Whitefly    Appearance: These small white-winged insects, at just 1 or 2 mm in length, look very much like white moths as adults and are related to aphids. You may well spot them on the underside of leaves; they prefer younger, fresher leaves and they will fly in clusters when you disturb them. Their lifecycle is only three weeks long, which means an infestation can occur very rapidly.  Key Signs of Whitefly Damage: Whiteflies cause damage by sucking the sap from plants. This may not be immediately visible – you are more likely to spot the insects themselves – but a large infestation can lead to a black sooty ‘mould’ like appearance on leaves, which weakens plant growth. They are particularly prevalent in greenhouses.  Favourite Plants to Consume: They can be found on a wide range of plants, including azaleas, rhododendrons, honeysuckle, plus edibles including cabbages, tomatoes and cucumbers.  Ways to Tackle: In greenhouses, you can catch adult whiteflies by hanging yellow sticky traps . You can also try companion planting as a form of deterrent; the strong smell of marigolds for example is a deterrent, so these are often grown next to vegetables or in a greenhouse. "
3,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Slugs,"Slugs    Appearance: An unmissable, squashy-looking body plus small sensory tentacles on its head. Slugs move along on one muscular foot. They range in scale from surprisingly small to terrifyingly large; limax cinereoniger species can grow comfortably beyond 20 cm in length.    Key Signs of Slug Damage: Ragged leaves with holes in them, scalloped bites / nibbles at the edges of leaves. You are likely to be able to spot silvery slime traces near the damaged plant, or on it. Slugs attack at night so look for fresh damage first thing in the morning to confirm suspicions (or head into the garden in the evening armed with a torch – be sure not to go bare footed!). Most plant damage is done by small slugs and snails that go unnoticed, rather than the huge ones found on lawns.  Favourite Plants to Consume: These voracious molluscs consume almost anything, but particularly love tender leaves along with vegetable, fruit, and salad crops.  Ways to Tackle: Encourage slugs’ natural enemies into your garden; slow worms if you are so lucky, hedgehogs, centipedes, and (perhaps less practically) ducks. Some natural methods , like placing copper coins around plants, can also meet with success. Failing that, try organic control methods such as Slug Gone Wool Pellets. "
4,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Cabbage Moth Caterpillar,"Cabbage Moth Caterpillar    Appearance: By no means the only caterpillar species to wish to chomp on your vegetables, cabbage moth caterpillars are particularly challenging as they will happily make their way into the heart of the brassica. The caterpillars are distinguished in shades of yellow or browny green with no hair.  Key Signs of Cabbage Moth Caterpillar Damage: Holes in the leaves of your brassicas. You may physically spot the caterpillars.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Cabbages and other brassicas – broccoli, sprouts.  Ways to Tackle: Create a garden ecosystem that includes natural predators – birds in particular. You could also place a net over your brassicas as they grow. It is also possible to pick off the caterpillars and any eggs regularly by hand. Use marigolds as a companion plant that repels the cabbage white butterfly (don’t plant marigolds too close though, as they can reduce the root growth of the cabbage). "
5,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Vine Weevil (adult and larvae),"Vine Weevil (adult and larvae)    Appearance: Otiorhyncus sulcatus, better known as black vine weevil, is a black-brown, moderately sized insect at around 1cm in length. It has a beetle-like appearance, with fused wings meaning they cannot fly, and orange hair tufts on their wing cases. Black vine weevil larvae are c-shaped, have no legs, and are white – rather like maggots but with copper colour heads. The weevils are all female and a male has never been identified, so one can soon become a big problem!    Key Signs of Black Vine Weevil Damage: These highly destructive garden pests feed on leaves as adults and have a calling card of notch-shaped bites around the edges. The larvae feed on plant roots, causing the entire plant to die.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Black vine weevils are responsible for attacking a huge range of plants both in the garden and home, from perennials to shrubs and trees. They are particularly keen on plants in containers, such as heucheras and hostas.  Ways to Tackle: Options for control include picking adult weevils off of plants and removing larvae from the soil. A garden full of the animals that eat them will also help; in particular birds (including chickens), frogs and hedgehogs. For the larvae, the soil can be treated with a predatory nematode. "
6,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Chafer Grub,"Chafer Grub    Appearance: Chafer grubs are the larvae of chafer beetles (cock chafer / Maybug, garden chafer or Welsh chafer) and live below ground in the soil. The cock chafer grub is found in beds and borders, feeding on plant roots. The other species feed on the roots of grasses and can wreak havoc on your lawn in particular. These fat white grubs have c-shaped bodies with light brown heads. Look for three sets of brown legs positioned near the head end to distinguish them from black vine weevil grubs.  Key Signs of Chafer Grub Damage: Wilting plants in borders or yellow patches of lawn and torn up turf where birds and other animals rummage for the grubs.  Favourite Plants to Consume: A variety of plants and grasses (lawns).  How to Tackle: One of the less common pests on this list, if found in beds and borders they can usually be removed with a trowel. For the lawn, water in the evening, cover with sheets to bring them to the surface then remove the cover at first light to create a feast for your garden birds. "
7,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Mealy Bug,"Mealy Bug    Appearance: Mealybugs are tiny oval-shaped insects that have a white, powdery wax coating. There are several different species, many of which have what looks like legs coming from their sides and back end. In their earliest stage of life, it’s entirely possible to mistake them for fungus and not recognise them as insects at all.  Key Signs of Mealy Bug Damage: Mealy bugs are sap-feeding insects. In the greenhouse, you will probably notice a white wax on less prominent parts of the plant under which are the insects or their eggs. Mealybugs excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which may cause black sooty mould on leaves.  Favourite Plants to Consume: A wide range of plants grown in the greenhouse, including citrus plants and tomatoes; houseplants and especially cacti, succulents, and orchids and less often outdoor plants including ceanothus, phormium, and bamboo.  How to Tackle: Always inspect plants very carefully when you buy them for signs of a mealybug population, particularly if they are going to be growing in your greenhouse. Be careful to remove dead leaves and debris from your greenhouse as these could harbour eggs. Ladybirds are natural consumers of mealybugs; encouraging them into your greenhouse may be a natural deterrent. While plants can survive a small amount of mealybug damage, if the infestation is severe it may, unfortunately, be best to dispose of the plant. If an infected plant is in a pot, quarantine that plant to prevent spread. Multiple treatments will most likely be required to control this difficult pest. "
8,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Lily Beetle,"Lily Beetle    Appearance: Adult lily beetles have a black head and legs combined with bright red wings. They grow to around 8mm long, so can be spotted relatively easily. Their eggs, which are laid on the underside of leaves are orangey-red. They emerge in mid-spring, having overwintered in sheltered spots such as among piles of leaves.  Key Signs of Lily Beetle Damage: These beetles make clearly visible holes in leaves and a severe infestation may eat through all foliage on a plant. If a plant has been attacked by lily beetles it can affect bulb development and the plant may not flower at all the following year.  Favourite Plants to Consume: They are almost entirely found on lilies and fritillaries; these at least are the only plants eggs are laid on.  How to Tackle: Inspect your lilies and fritillaries regularly all through the growing season. Your plants will be able to survive a small amount of damage, so you may choose to ignore a minor amount. You can also remove beetles by hand. The best natural control method is predators including birds, frogs, and wasps. There are insecticides available if other methods fail to keep an infestation under control. "
9,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Two-Spotted Spider Mite,"Two-Spotted Spider Mite    Appearance: A tiny and common eight-legged insect, only around 0.4mm in length and oval in shape. The two spotted spider mite is orange-red to dark green in colour and has two or four very dark dorsal spots.  Key Signs of Two Spotted Spider Mite Damage: Attacked plants may develop a pale mottled appearance. The mites may be found under leaves, but may be difficult to say without the aid of a magnifying device. Leaves may fall off the plant and in really severe cases webbing may form over the plants, which can die under a heavy infestation.  Favourite Plants to Consume: This voracious mite will feed on a wide variety of plants, including greenhouse plants and houseplants. They are not usually a problem outside, but in very prolonged hot periods they will begin to appear outside too and attack plants in your beds and borders, including fuchsias and pelargoniums.  Ways to Tackle: Two spotted spider mites tend to be at their worst in hot dry summers, which helps them breed more quickly. You can spray affected plants with an insecticidal soap to control the worst of it. It is also particularly important with greenhouses to disinfect and clear thoroughly before the winter, to minimise any mites that may be trying to shelter there for the winter. Generally they attack plants that are under stress, so keeping plants well fed and watered enables them to better fend off the attack. "
10,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Leaf Hopper,"Leaf Hopper    Appearance: These small insects are typically around 2-3mm long. The different species are mainly green or yellow in colour with mottled markings. They are thin with a body in the shape of a winged, narrow wedge.  Key Signs of Leaf Hopper Damage: A key sign of leafhoppers is the sight of them ‘hopping’ (as per their name) off plants when disturbed. They are present on the underside of the leaves and as the infestation grows the leaf will become pale in colour with mottled white on its upper side.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Leafhoppers feed on the sap of a wide variety of plants; some are specific to a single variety such as the rhododendron leafhopper and potato leafhopper. They are very often found on scented plants, such as herbs, lavander, and nepeta. In the greenhouse, they are particularly keen on tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers and outdoors foxgloves, pelargoniums, and nicotianas are just some of their favourite plants.  Ways to Tackle: Check your plants regularly for any signs of leafhoppers from their growing season in spring. A small amount of damage will not destroy plants and natural predators such as birds, ladybirds, and wasps should do a good job at keeping them under control. If they are becoming a nuisance, insecticides are available for control. "
11,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Leaf Miner (inc. Allium Leaf Miner),"Leaf Miner (inc. Allium Leaf Miner)    Appearance: Leaf miners are small insects that lay eggs on a variety of garden plants. One of the more recent of these in the UK is the allium leaf miner, which was first spotted here in 2002. The flies of the species are small, around 3mm in length. Leaf miners lay eggs on plants in early to mid-spring once they awake from overwintering.  Key Signs of Leaf Miner Damage: These insects actually eat the inside of the leaf (‘mining’), which leads to distinctive trail-shaped damage on foliage.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Depending on the insect they will be found on apples, holly, chrysanthemum, horse chestnut trees and alliums. The allium leaf miner actually consumes plants across the entire allium family, including leeks, onions, garlic, chives and shallots.  Ways to Tackle: There are limited ways to tackle this particular pest. Covering your plants with insect mesh – particularly in early spring and late autumn – is the best option. Crops, once affected, will not be able to be stored and will need to be safely destroyed. "
12,https://www.hillier.co.uk/garden-and-home-ideas/uk-garden-pests/,Guide to Common Garden Pests,Scale Insect,"Scale Insect    Appearance: Scale insects are an ancient species with a diverse appearance. They can vary from 1-2mm to larger insects covered in wax. Mealybugs are technically a scale insect – one of the only species of scale insect that can move from the plant it inhabits. Female scale insects typically have soft bodies without legs, hidden beneath domed scales and they extrude a waxy substance. Males may look more like small flies.    Key Signs of Scale Insect Damage: Scale insects can cause serious damage. They can sometimes be identified by spotting scales or small bumps on stems and beneath leaves. Some leave a waxy substance on the top of leaves. The presence of Honeydew (a clear, sticky substance, often accompanied by a black sooty coating) is another good indicator of scale insects.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Scale insects suck the sap from a number of plants, including perennials, shrubs like camellias, fruit crops – especially citrus – and houseplants.  Ways to Tackle: If there is a small number, you may be able to pick them off with your nail. Birds are also a natural predator, so encourage them into your garden. Otherwise, treat with an organic spray, such as Resolva Natural Power Bug & Mildew Control. It may require multiple treatments as they are well protected by their waxy covering. Best results are usually achieved earlier in the season when the youngsters are still mobile (in their crawler stage). "

The caterpillars of the tortix moth develop from eggs in a matter of a few weeks and are small and green. The caterpillars roll themselves up in the leaves that they then feed on.  Key Signs of Tortix Moth Damage:  Favourite Plants to Consume: Tortix moths will go for your fruit plants and ornamental plants, both inside and outside. They can be particularly damaging in greenhouses.  Ways to Tackle: As totrix moths tend to overwinter before emerging in spring, keeping plants free of debris underneath them is a good way to prevent this. You can also squash caterpillars that you find rolled up in leaves. "

At the same time, it will cover itself in a white waxy substance.  Key Signs of Woolly Aphid Damage: From spring into autumn look out for a fluffy white wax, that you may first mistake for fungal growth. Colonies on shoots will cause lumpy growths.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Woolly aphids are found on apple trees, pyracantha, and Cotoneaster.  Ways to Tackle: Check any apple, pyracantha or Cotoneaster plants from spring onwards for any signs of woolly aphids. You can use a brush to scrub away the insects in small numbers. If left, then natural predators such as ladybirds, hoverfly larvae and lacewings will rapidly find and prey on the aphids. If the infestation becomes too large, organic controls are available. "

The black-brown bodies give way to frightening looking pincers on the back, although these are completely harmless. There are hundreds of different earwig species create damage by chewing on the flowers and vegetables.  Did you know: despite folklore tales, earwig don’t like to crawl into people’s ears!  Key Signs of Earwig Damage: Look for ragged edges or holes on leaves and petals. Favourite Plants to Consume: A wide range of flowers, fruit and vegetables.  Ways to Tackle: Earwigs can bring as much benefit as damage to the garden, eating small insects – in particular fruit aphids. If the population is getting out of control, you could set simple traps by placing a flower pot filled with compost, grass or paper near the house and then emptying of any residing earwigs in the morning.

They are a particular problem in the South of England, though may inevitably spread further north. The caterpillars are green-yellow in colour with black heads, growing to 4cm in length.    Key Signs of Box Tree Caterpillar Damage: You are likely to be able to spot the caterpillars and their webbing on your box plant. Once they go to work, your box plant may be completely defoliated. Note – box tree caterpillar damage is entirely separate to the fungal disease box blight.  Favourite Plants to Consume: Buxus (box).  Ways to Tackle: Remove caterpillars by hand if possible. Encouraging more birds in your garden may help tackle them naturally, but is not known to what extent. Alternatively, consider insecticide for control or, as a last resort, choose an alternative plant. If your plant survives after an attack, keep it well fed to help regrowth. "

Any sightings of these should be reported to the relevant authority.  Oak Processionary Caterpillar / Moth    First spotted in the UK in London in 2006, the oak processionary caterpillar has also been found in some surrounding counties. The caterpillars and their nests have long hairs that can cause an itchy rash or eye and throat irritations in humans and should not be touched under any circumstances at any time.  The caterpillars feed on oak leaves and can leave the tree vulnerable to attacks from other pests and diseases. Any sightings should be reported to help control the spread of this pest.

Avoid problems in your garden by feeding plants regularly (with the right feed!), and making sure they have enough water. An automatic irrigation system that can be controlled from a timer or a phone app is an absolute god send for this. Managing trees and hedges will improve air flow around your plants and discourage fungal disease. And a good layer of mulch will help to keep weeds under control. If you do spot any anything out of the ordinary. Investigate immediately, to find out if you have a problem and what might be causing it. The quicker you take any necessary action, the less likely it is that the invading pest or disease will be able to permanently damage your plants. Depending on what it is, you may be able to find a cultural cure for the problem. Perhaps water a bit more (or a bit less), feed the plant or pick off any bugs. Sometimes though, the quickest and most effective solution is to use a chemical spray."

And then research the most effective active ingredient for that problem. If possible use a specialist chemical, one that is specific to the problem. It’s a bit like taking yourself to the Doctor with an infection. Your GP may prescribe a general antibiotic in the hope that the pathogen that’s making you ill, will succumb. However, some bacteria or fungi don’t respond to just any old antibiotic. There are specific pills for specific bugs. It’s the same with garden chemicals. For example a general purpose fungicide is unlikely to be effective against red thread disease in your lawn. Conversely, a universal herbicide will damage all of your favourite plants as well as the weeds. And an overall pesticide will devastate pollinating insects as well as aphids. It’s important that before you look for chemical controls, you must really know your foe and only target plants, microbes or insects that are actually causing damage."

The active ingredient must be applied in the right quantities and at the right time. A farmer or horticulturist will buy concentrated spray, dilute it with the correct ratio of chemical to water and then spray a prescribed amount on to an area of land. Eg 2 litres of diluted spray to 1 hectare of land. In garden centre chemicals, the active ingredient is often pre- diluted – in other words, the pre-mixed spray is weak. The manufacturers are assuming that whoever is applying the spray is untrained and therefore they try to make the product as safe as possible. Unfortunately, unless you are an excellent judge of application rates, the dilution rate means that the spray may be less effective. With fungal diseases and insects, any organisms that are not destroyed by the first application of spray are likely to breed chemical-resistant offspring. Which in the long term is not helpful. (it’s the equivalent of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the human or animal worlds) Trained professionals however, have access to less dilute and therefore more effective sprays. In some cases we can also buy specialist sprays that are not readily available to the general public."

Does it need time to dry onto the plants before it can take effect? Should you avoid using it in hot weather? How long does it take to work? Can it be used on edibles? If so, can you harvest food crops straight away or do you need to leave a period of time between spraying and eating? Lots of questions but trust me, they are all very relevant. Not sure?

All agricultural chemicals have been rigorously tested to ensure that they do minimal damage to the environment and everything in it. However, when you are getting up close with concentrates you could be vulnerable. Especially if you are sensitive to any of the ingredients. Always wear protective clothing when you are spraying your plants. A white boiler suit with a hood so that you can spot any spills as soon as they happen. A mask for your nose and mouth to reduce the risk of inhaling fuels or microdroplets. Gloves of course and goggles to protect your eyes.  You might feel very hot and look like an alien but that’s better than the alternative! Getting best value from chemical controls Use the right chemical for the job. Some professional grade chemicals are very specific whereas garden centre sprays tend to be more general Handle all chemicals with extreme care. Wear protective clothing Never mix chemicals – they may react with each other in unexpected ways Follow the manufacturers’ recommended application rates to the letter. No more, no less. If you’re not sure how to work out the proportions of concentrate and water– ask. Clean up spills quickly and carefully. Use sand or cat litter to soak up any liquid – never wash it down the drain. Work with the weather. On windy days you can soon waste a lot of valuable chemical by letting it blow all over the place If possible, spot treat weeds rather than applying a blanket spray. Investigate more environmentally friendly solutions before paying for chemicals. Eg biological controls or simply tolerating a few aphids on your roses. Dispose of all packaging responsibly Employ the services of a trained professional. When you consider things like protective clothing, more effective chemicals, secure storage and legislation, it’s probably more cost effective than treating the problem yourself.

2,https://gardenforwildlife.com/blogs/learning-center/natural-pest-control-for-gardens,Natural Pest Control for Gardens,Understanding garden pests,"Understanding garden pests  In the vast diversity of North American gardens, a variety of creatures find their haven and hunting grounds. While many insects and animals play pivotal roles in the pollination and aeration of the soil, some become notorious as garden pests. Understanding these creatures is crucial in developing strategies for natural pest control for gardens.  Pests in the garden can range from microscopic nematodes to larger mammals like deer and moles, each with their own unique impact on the health of your plants. Insects such as aphids, caterpillars, and Japanese beetles can be found feasting on leaves, stems, and the very vitality of plants.  However, not all insects are foes. Many are essential allies, contributing to a balanced ecosystem. For instance, while caterpillars may nibble on leaves, they eventually transform into pollinating butterflies. Similarly, ants can be garden protectors, aerating the soil and controlling other pests. In the struggle against aphids, the introduction of plants like swamp milkweed and orange butterfly milkweed can attract beneficial predators and serve as a great line of defense due to their pest-resistant nature.   The key is to discern between the harmful and helpful, ensuring our efforts to control pests in the garden organically don’t upset the delicate equilibrium nature has set.  It's not just the insect pests we need to be mindful of. Mammals such as rabbits and moles also pose challenges. Rabbits can decimate a crop of young vegetables or ornamental plants overnight, and moles, while generally insectivores, can disrupt root systems with their burrowing.  Understanding the habits, life cycles, and ecological roles of these garden dwellers is the first step in managing them. Knowing when aphids are most likely to proliferate or what attracts deer can inform your strategy on how to get rid of pests in the garden naturally.  This knowledge allows us to take preemptive action, such as introducing deterrents or making the environment less inviting for unwanted visitors without resorting to harsh chemicals.  In our mission to control pests organically, we’re not just gardeners but also guardians of our environment, ensuring every action is in harmony with the natural world.  "
3,https://gardenforwildlife.com/blogs/learning-center/natural-pest-control-for-gardens,Natural Pest Control for Gardens,The principles of natural pest control,"The principles of natural pest control  Beginning a more natural pest control for gardens requires a foundational understanding of the principles governing this approach. To manage pests in the garden organically, we have to embrace the complexity of the ecosystem and the many interactions that sustain it. The goal is to allow gardeners to control garden pests without compromising the environmental integrity of their cherished green spaces.    The bedrock of balance : A garden is a microcosm of the broader ecosystem. In it, every creature, from the smallest nematode to the busiest bee, has a role. Natural pest control leverages this biodiversity, creating conditions unfavorable for pests while fostering a thriving community of beneficial organisms.    The introduction of native plants is an option that can attract predatory insects that feed on common pests, thus maintaining a natural check on their populations. For example, the purple coneflower is a native plant that enhances the visual appeal of a garden and serves as a robust attractor for beneficial insects, like bees and butterflies, which are natural predators of common pests.     Companion planting : Some plants have natural repellent properties against specific pests and, when planted strategically, can protect more vulnerable species. This method of organically controlling garden pests adds diversity to the garden and harnesses the inherent pest-resistant characteristics of certain plants, reducing the need for any external interventions.    Planting slender mountain mint can help deter certain pests with its strong scent, while spotted bee balm can entice pollinators, enhancing plant health and resistance to pests.    Physical interventions : Sometimes, immediate physical action is required to manage an infestation. Handpicking pests, using water sprays to dislodge aphids, or applying barriers to prevent slugs from reaching tender plants are all methods aligned with naturally ridding the garden of pests. These techniques are simple yet effective and, when done regularly, can significantly reduce pest populations.    By understanding and applying these principles, gardeners can create a more resilient garden ecosystem. The subsequent sections will delve into specific strategies and techniques to apply these principles, ensuring the natural beauty and health of your garden are preserved.  "
4,https://gardenforwildlife.com/blogs/learning-center/natural-pest-control-for-gardens,Natural Pest Control for Gardens,Preventative measures,"Preventative measures  A proactive approach is often the most effective when it comes to natural pest control for gardens. By taking steps to prevent pests from becoming established in the first place, gardeners can save time and avoid the damage these creatures can inflict on plants.    Garden hygiene : Regular maintenance is key. Removing plant debris and diseased foliage can greatly reduce the places where pests can breed and overwinter. Ensuring cleanliness is a simple yet vital practice in controlling garden pests organically.      Choosing resistant varieties : Selecting plant species and varieties known for their resistance to pests is a cornerstone of pest management. These plants can naturally deter or withstand the pressures of pests in the garden, minimizing the need for interventions. For instance, plants such as wild geranium are known for their hardiness and ability to repel certain garden pests, serving as natural deterrents and reducing the need for additional pest control measures.        Cultivating plant health : Strong plants are less likely to succumb to pest infestations. Adequate watering and suitable planting locations are vital factors contributing to the overall health of garden plants. By focusing on these, gardeners can reduce the likelihood of pests becoming a significant problem.      Diversity in planting : A diverse garden is a more protected one. Planting a variety of species can reduce the spread of pests on plants, as many pests are specific to certain plant types. By diversifying plantings with species like woodland sunflower and wild geranium , gardeners can create an environment less hospitable to pests and more attractive to beneficial insects. Intercropping and rotating crops each season can help to break pest life cycles, making it a practical aspect of how to get rid of pests in the garden naturally.    These preventative strategies form the first line of defense, creating a hostile environment for pests and a sanctuary for your plants. By implementing these measures, gardeners can often avoid the need for further pest control actions, ensuring a vibrant and healthy garden with the gentlest touch on the ecosystem.  "
5,https://gardenforwildlife.com/blogs/learning-center/natural-pest-control-for-gardens,Natural Pest Control for Gardens,Biological controls for garden pests,"Biological controls for garden pests  Embracing nature’s own checks and balances is at the heart of controlling garden pests organically. Biological control involves introducing or encouraging natural predators to manage pest populations, a key tactic in the arsenal of natural pest control for gardens.    Beneficial insects : The garden is a battlefield, and allies such as ladybugs, praying mantises, and lacewings are invaluable in the fight against pests on plants. These predatory species devour aphids, mites, and other small pests, providing a significant advantage in maintaining the garden’s health without using chemicals.    The key is choosing native plants that attract these predators. You could plant slender mountain mint or one of our Bee Balm Plant Sets to attract beneficial insects, leveraging their natural predation to maintain a healthy garden.    Birds and bats : Avian and chiropteran species can be encouraged to take up residence in the garden by providing nesting boxes and water sources. These creatures consume vast quantities of insects, naturally reducing pest populations.     Their presence isn’t only beneficial for pest control but also adds to the garden’s vibrancy and diversity. You can easily create a more bat-friendly garden with a careful selection of the right plants.  This integrative approach aligns with the principles of permaculture and sustainable gardening , offering a long-term solution to pest problems. By leveraging biological controls, gardeners can create a self-regulating ecosystem where the need for intervention is minimized, and the garden's natural harmony is preserved.  "

These methods focus on altering the environment to make it less conducive to pests, employing manual techniques and garden planning strategies to reduce pest impact.    Barriers and traps : Floating row covers, netting, and fences can physically block pests from reaching plants. Similarly, traps with lures can capture pests like Japanese beetles, disrupting their lifecycle and preventing damage.      Water management : Overwatering can attract pests such as mosquitoes that breed in standing water. Proper irrigation practices help prevent this while ensuring plants remain healthy and less susceptible to pests. It’s also worth considering including a few wildlife-friendly water features in your garden design, which can also be useful for attracting the right birds, insects, and mammals.    Implementing these physical and cultural controls can greatly aid in controlling garden pests organically, reducing the need for interventions and helping maintain a balanced, productive garden.  "

Maintaining biodiversity in our gardens enriches the habitat and fortifies against pest invasions. Planting native species such as zig-zag goldenrod and eastern columbine can enhance the ecological balance, naturally deterring pests.  By planting native species, we support a variety of wildlife, from pollinators to predatory insects, each playing a role in the natural pest control of gardens.  Native plants are adapted to local pests and diseases and often require less maintenance. They form symbiotic relationships with native wildlife, providing the necessary resources for their survival while also receiving the benefits of pollination and pest control. By encouraging this biodiversity, we create ecosystems more resilient to pests.  This approach underscores the importance of every choice we make in our gardens, from the plants we select to the materials we use.

Here’s a brief overview of some of the most common ones:   Aphids : These small, sap-sucking insects can cause distortions in plant growth and spread diseases.  Scale insects : Like aphids, they feed on plant sap and can weaken plants over time.  Mealybugs : Recognisable by their white, cottony appearance, these pests can cause yellowing and wilting in plants.  Spider mites : These tiny mites can cause significant damage by sucking nutrients from plant leaves.  Caterpillars : Known for their voracious appetite, caterpillars can defoliate plants if left unchecked.  Grubs: These soil-dwelling larvae can damage roots and stunt plant growth.  Weevils : Weevil larvae can bore into plant stems and roots, causing wilting and sometimes plant death.  Snails and slugs : These molluscs are notorious for eating plant leaves, stems, and seedlings.  Mammals and birds : Some larger animals, like possums and birds, can also become pests by damaging plants and eating fruits and vegetables.   Keep in mind that “pest” is a term that we use as humans to describe insects that we don’t like. There are examples of both native and exotic organisms within the above list, and almost all of them are incredibly important within the ecosystem. They exist on the bottom of the food chain and feed animals that are higher on the food chain.  A healthy garden will have all types of “pests,” but the difference is that they’re kept in balance with their natural predators.  Besides, without caterpillars, you won’t have any butterflies. Do you really want a garden without butterflies ?       A common native sap-sucking pest for lilly pillies are psyllids.    "

Some plants have natural pest-repelling properties, making them excellent additions to any pest-resistant garden. And plants that you know will thrive in your garden’s conditions will be healthier, meaning that they’ll be more naturally resistant to pests and diseases. Conversely, if you choose the wrong plants for your garden’s environment, they’ll become weak and easy targets for pests.  For example, moisture-loving, shade-loving plants that are planted in sandy sunny spots will always suffer. Some plants are particularly susceptible to certain pests, such as lilly pillies and the sap-sucking psyllids (which are a relative of aphids and scale).

Organic fertilisers improve the soil’s structure, enhance its ability to hold onto nutrients and water, and foster beneficial soil organisms. They also provide your plants with the nutrients they need to grow healthily.  For sandy soil, incorporate organic matter to improve its nutrient-holding capacity. For silty and clayey soils, organic matter can help prevent compaction and improve drainage. If your garden has loamy soil, regular additions of organic matter will help maintain its quality. Compacted or heavy clays can be broken apart using gypsum to improve drainage and structure. Meanwhile, hydrophobic sandy soils can be amended using a soil wetter as a short-term fix.

If lawn pests like moles can’t seem to get enough of playing your yard, lawn aerators can smooth out these bumps and blemishes. However, use this tool sparingly, as it can induce stress to your grass. When you do perform a roll-over, the dirt should be moist but not wet; soaked soil increases compaction, thus decreasing aeration (and the health of your lawn).

Cleaning and Storing Your Garden Tools for Winter  Depending on how brutal your winters are, each year, there’s likely a point at which you allow your garden—and garden tools—to hibernate. It’s wise to clean up your equipment before storing it away to prevent damage or further rust and to ensure it’s ready to go for next season.    Here are some sanitation and storage tips to keep in mind:   Consider taking your tools apart to clean hard-to-reach spots.  Rinse dirt off tools with a water hose, then dry with a cotton cloth.  Thoroughly clean any tools with tines inside and out with water and a cloth or brush.  For stubborn dirt and rust, scrub with steel wool, a bristle brush, or a thick cotton cloth.  Use a file or stone to sharpen the blades of tools.  Apply a light coat of oil to prevent rust.  Motor oil, WD-40, or even vegetable oil are effective rust preventers because it insulates steel, preventing it from oxidizing.  Oil can be applied to metal surfaces either by spraying or wiping it on with a rag.    Hang tools by their handles on a wall in your shed or garage; this will keep them organized, out of the way, and protected from damage.  For fuel-powered tools:  Lubricate all lubrication fittings.  Disconnect all batteries and spark plugs.  Clean or replace any air filters.  If storage will exceed 30 days, empty any tanks containing pump gasoline, as it deteriorates quickly.  For edgers, trimmers, chainsaws, and tools with similar engines, empty the tank and run at an idle until all the fuel is used up.  For lawnmowers, it’s generally recommended to add a fuel stabilizer to the tank instead of draining it. Run the engine to mix the stabilizer into the system, then fill the tank with fresh fuel; this prevents the accumulation of damaging water condensation during storage.    "

Other elements that will help you succeed are choosing fast-growing veggie varieties, and staggering your planting so that your crops overlap (we'll get to that). The main options for places to plant are in garden beds, raised freestanding beds or pots . If you're digging directly into the soil, raise the soil level in the bed by adding compost and manure. This will not only help provide nutrients, it will also improve drainage. You can either mound it up in the bed, or build a frame of timber sleepers and fill that up."

While both are termed ""organic matter"", compost is generally decomposed plant-based material (made from your garden and kitchen waste) and is great for ""conditioning"" soil: it makes clay soil less dense so it drains better, and adds body to sandy soil, allowing it to retain more nutrients and water. It also stimulates soil microbes into action (that's a good thing). Composting really can be simple. This is how to make a startAvoiding waste and diverting food scraps from landfill is a no-brainer. But how?Read more While it contains nutrients, the levels are usually far less intense than in manure. Manure is generally decomposed animal waste ; it might contain a mix of faeces, urine, spilt food and bedding (for example, hay from horse stables). It is a great source of nutrients for plants, being very high in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Of course, the exact levels vary depending on the animal it comes from and other additives. Some shop-bought manure is bulked out with a lot of vegetable matter, and going the other way, some people add manure to their compost. Just don't add cat and dog poo, as these can contain parasites that won't break down as easily. Dog and cat poo can be buried and will break down, but you don't want it anywhere near your veggie bed. The veggies versus meat distinction extends to liquid garden products. Seaweed-based solutions are great soil conditioners but not strictly fertilisers, whereas fish-based ones are very high in nutrients and are potent fertilisers."

There's no getting around it, you'll need to do some research. Sorry. If you only have room for pots on a balcony, then buy two or three of the biggest pots you can manage (about 60 centimetres across the top is ideal — you might want to consider wheels underneath to make them mobile).

You can choose crops by when to plant them or follow some suggested plant combinations. Growing veggies without a gardenWhether you've only got a courtyard, a balcony or even just a windowsill, many veggies and herbs can be grown with limited soil and space.Read more As well as simply thinking about what you like eating, here are some other points to consider: Pick veggies that are expensive or hard to find in the shops. Herbs are a great example. Brown onions are cheap but shallots can cost a lot, so try them. Same goes for cherry-sized tomatoes, which cost heaps more than regular ones. Another thought-starter: fresh peas are hard to find in shops but really easy and fun to grow. What conditions you're working with. Most veggies like 6-8 hours of sun a day, but large-leafed plants such as silverbeet, lettuce and some herbs are plants that will cope with a shadier spot . How much space you have. Some plants are slow growing or take up a lot of space, so they're less practical to grow in a small space — unless you can find a dwarf variety. Instead, focus on the plants that take up less space, are easier to grow and that you can turn over quickly. ""Cut-and-come again"" varieties are useful. Rather than producing just one head of lettuce or broccoli, these types keep producing side shoots or leaves for several weeks so you can harvest them for longer. For broccoli, go to a nursery and look for ones with ""sprouting"" in the name. For lettuce, choose the loose-leaf types. Include some insect-friendly flowers and herbs. These not only look nice but also attract pollinators and predatory bugs (to eat the baddies). You can use many of the flowers in salads and they make good edging plants, as do permanents such as strawberries."

Regular watering is essential (don't flood them, just make sure your watering is consistent). As they start to produce crops, it helps to add a serve of liquid fertiliser a couple of times a month. Add more compost when replanting, and add manure before planting heavy croppers, such as corn, brassicas (cauliflower, kale, broccoli, etc.), melons, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers and tomatoes. 7 Tips: Growing tomatoesWhat's missing in your life? It could be the taste of a real tomato, at least that's what Adrian van Leest believes.Read more Looking for more help? Planting seedlings (instead of seeds) of slow-growing plants such as broccoli gives you a head start, but root crops (potatoes, carrots), peas and beans are always better grown from seed; they just don't like being moved. Another trick to maximise space is to squeeze a faster-growing crop around a slower-growing one. For example, a tomato plant will eventually need a square metre of soil and can grow 1.5-2 metres tall — but not overnight. Speedy little lettuce, Asian greens and radishes can be planted, grow, and be harvested before the tomato even knows what's happening. With the point above in mind, don't be tempted to cram larger plants in too close or the whole row will struggle. Follow the spacing suggested on the pack you bought them in. Plant taller crops on the southern or western side of the patch, graded down in height to the smallest ones at the front, so everything gets a share of sun. If you have space (and time), allow one or two plants to go to seed — the flowers attract the pollinators for other crops and will provide you with seed for next season. It can be hard to keep track of what has been growing where but it's important because the same plants shouldn't go in the same spot year after year. Get a notebook to jot down what you plant. It will also help you build up a picture of what does well where and when. You can learn more about the best sequences for crop rotation here. Finally, when your plants do start producing (yay!) make sure you harvest regularly. Your plants are on a mission to reproduce and, as you keep stealing their babies, they'll be triggered into producing more. This especially applies to cucumbers, zucchini and peas."

Dress Up Garden Entrances  Even in a small landscape, a sequence of discrete spaces, connected by passageways and paths, adds a sense of mystery and expansiveness to an ordinary stroll. The Bealls created a journey that begins with a wisteria-draped arbor near the house and winds downhill, across terraces, along walks, and down steps that continue the theme of eye-catching, weatherworn stone. Paths indicate the way; iron arches and gates—many from gardener’s-supply catalogs and covered with vines—mark transitions to different areas. Potted bougainvillea, citrus trees, and palms further accent entries, as do finials perched on pedestals."

Listening to its music, you want to track it to its source, and in the Bealls’ landscape there are many. A fountain with an octagonal basin creates the liquid soundtrack for the herb garden. Another, echoing the columnar shape of Italian cypress trees nearby, bubbles amid flower-like agaves, drawing hummingbirds in droves. Both pieces were pottery-yard scores."

Brushing Basics: Keeping the Coat in Check,"1. Brushing Basics: Keeping the Coat in Check  Maintaining your French Bulldog's coat is a fundamental aspect of grooming that goes beyond mere aesthetics. Here's a closer look at the brushing basics:  Frequency:  Brush your Frenchie at least once a week. While they may not have the luscious locks of some other breeds, regular brushing helps remove loose hair, prevent matting, and distribute natural oils for a healthy coat.  Tools:  Opt for a soft-bristle brush or a grooming mitt. Given their sensitive skin, these tools provide a gentle touch, preventing irritation during the brushing process.  Focus Areas:  Pay particular attention to those signature wrinkles on their face. These adorable folds are charming but can trap moisture, leading to skin issues. Gently clean and dry between the wrinkles to maintain skin health.  Importance:  Regular brushing not only keeps your Frenchie looking neat but also promotes good skin and coat health. It's a bonding experience too, allowing you to check for any irregularities like lumps, bumps, or skin irritations.   "

Bath Time: A Splash of Cleanliness,"2. Bath Time: A Splash of Cleanliness  Bathing your French Bulldog is a crucial aspect of their grooming routine. While they might not require frequent baths, ensuring the process is done correctly is essential. Let's dive into the details of Frenchie bath time:  Frequency:  Aim to bathe your Frenchie every 1-2 months, or as needed. Over-bathing can strip their skin of natural oils, so it's essential to find the right balance for your individual dog.  Shampoo Selection:  Choose a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo. Frenchies can have sensitive skin, and using a gentle shampoo helps prevent irritation and allergies. Avoid using human shampoos, as they may contain ingredients that can be harsh on your pup's skin.  Wrinkle Care:  Given their distinctive facial wrinkles, pay special attention to cleaning between these folds. Moisture accumulation in these areas can lead to skin problems. Use a damp cloth to gently clean and ensure these areas are thoroughly dry post-bath.  Importance:  Bathing not only keeps your Frenchie smelling fresh but also helps to keep their coat and skin healthy.  Drying Technique:  After the bath, gently pat your Frenchie dry with old towels. Ensure their coat is completely dry, especially between wrinkles.  Caution:  Avoid over-bathing or using harsh chemicals, as this can lead to skin dryness and other skin problems. If you're unsure about the right products or frequency, consult your veterinarian for guidance.  By incorporating regular baths into your Frenchie's routine, you'll not only keep them clean but also contribute to their overall health and well-being.   "

Nail Care: Tending to Those Paws,"3. Nail Care: Tending to Those Paws  Keeping your French Bulldog's nails in check is a vital aspect of their grooming routine. While it may not be their favorite activity, regular nail care is essential for their comfort. Let's delve into the details of Frenchie nail care:  Frequency:  Trim your Frenchie's nails every 2-4 weeks, or as needed. The frequency depends on their activity level and how quickly their nails naturally wear down. Regular trimming prevents discomfort and potential health issues.  Tools:  Invest in a small dog nail clipper or grinder. Clippers come in various styles, including guillotine and scissor types. Choose one that you find comfortable and easy to use. If you're unsure, consult your vet or a professional groomer for advice.  Trimming Technique:  Be cautious when trimming to avoid cutting into the quick — the sensitive part of the nail containing blood vessels and nerves. Trim small sections at a time until you reach the desired length. If in doubt, it's better to trim less than risk cutting too much.  Importance:  Regular nail care prevents your Frenchie from experiencing discomfort or difficulty walking. Long nails can affect their posture and lead to joint issues. Additionally, it reduces the risk of accidental scratches to you and others.  Caution:  Take care not to cut too close to the quick, as this can be painful and may cause bleeding. If you're uncertain or uncomfortable trimming your Frenchie's nails, seek professional assistance. Some dogs may be more sensitive to nail trimming, so introducing the process gradually can help ease any anxiety.   "

Ear Maintenance: Ensuring Healthy Auditory Wellness,"4. Ear Maintenance: Ensuring Healthy Auditory Wellness  Caring for your French Bulldog's ears is a critical part of their overall grooming routine. Due to their unique bat-like ears, Frenchies are prone to ear issues, making regular maintenance essential. Here's a closer look at how to keep those ears in top shape:  Frequency:  Clean your Frenchie's ears as needed, typically every 3-4 weeks. Regular checks will help you gauge when cleaning is necessary.  Cleaning Technique:  Use a vet-approved ear cleaning solution and a cotton ball to gently clean the ears. Avoid inserting anything into the ear canal, as this can cause injury. The goal is to remove excess wax and debris from the outer part of the ear.  Signs to Watch For:  Keep an eye out for signs of redness, swelling, a foul odor, or excessive wax buildup. These could indicate an ear infection or other ear-related issues. If you notice any of these signs, consult your vet promptly.  Importance:  Regular ear maintenance helps prevent infections and discomfort for your Frenchie. Their unique ear structure can trap moisture, making them more susceptible to issues, especially if the ears are not kept clean and dry.  Caution:  Take a gentle approach when cleaning your Frenchie's ears. If you're unsure about the proper technique or notice any concerning symptoms, seek advice from your veterinarian. It's essential to address ear issues promptly to avoid complications.   "

Dental Care: Nurturing Healthy Smiles,"5. Dental Care: Nurturing Healthy Smiles  Maintaining your French Bulldog's dental health is more than just ensuring a fresh breath; it's a crucial aspect of their overall well-being. Let's dive into the details of how to keep those pearly whites in top condition:  Frequency:  Make dental care a daily routine for your Frenchie. Daily brushing is optimal, but if that's not feasible, aim for at least 2-3 times a week. Consistency is key to preventing dental issues.  Toothbrush and Toothpaste:  Use a dog-friendly toothbrush and toothpaste. Human toothpaste can be harmful, so opt for veterinary-approved products. Introduce the toothbrush gradually to make the experience positive for your Frenchie.  Dental Chews and Toys:  Provide dental chews and toys to supplement your Frenchie's oral care routine. Chewing helps reduce plaque and tartar buildup. Ensure the products are appropriate for your dog's size and chewing habits.  Signs of Dental Issues:  Be vigilant for signs of dental problems, including bad breath, swollen or bleeding gums, difficulty chewing, or a reluctance to eat. If you notice any of these signs, consult your vet promptly.  Professional Dental Check-ups:  Schedule regular dental check-ups with your veterinarian. Professional cleanings may be necessary to address tartar buildup and ensure optimal oral health.  Importance:  Regular dental care is essential for preventing dental diseases, which can impact your Frenchie's overall health. Poor oral hygiene can lead to issues like gum disease and tooth loss.  Caution:  If you're new to brushing your Frenchie's teeth, be patient. Start slowly, and use positive reinforcement to make the experience enjoyable.   "

Coat Care: Nurturing a Shiny and Healthy Coat,"6. Coat Care: Nurturing a Shiny and Healthy Coat  French Bulldogs boast a short and smooth coat, but that doesn't mean they don't benefit from a bit of coat care. Let's delve into the details of how to keep your Frenchie's coat looking its best:  Shedding:  Frenchies are not heavy shedders, but regular brushing helps control loose hair.  Seasonal Changes:  Be prepared for a bit more shedding during seasonal changes. While Frenchies don't undergo significant coat changes like some breeds, they may experience a slight increase in shedding.  Professional Grooming:  Consider professional grooming for specialized services. While Frenchies are generally low-maintenance hair-wise, a professional groomer can provide services like nail trimming, expressing anal glands, and checking for any skin abnormalities.  Moisturizing:  Use a vet-recommended moisturizer to prevent dry skin. While Frenchies are less prone to skin issues, keeping their skin moisturized can contribute to a healthy and comfortable coat.  Signs of Allergies:  Monitor for signs of allergies, such as itching or redness.    Caution:  If you opt for professional grooming, communicate your preferences to the groomer to ensure they follow your desired grooming routine.    "

Eye Care: Ensuring Bright and Healthy Eyes,"7. Eye Care: Ensuring Bright and Healthy Eyes  The distinctive and expressive eyes of French Bulldogs are one of their charming features. Let's delve into the details of how to care for your Frenchie's eyes:  Tear Stains:  Frenchies may develop tear stains, which are reddish-brown streaks under the eyes. Wipe away tear stains gently with a damp cloth. Regular cleaning helps prevent staining and keeps the area around the eyes clean.  Monitor for Discharge:  Keep an eye out for any unusual eye discharge, which may indicate an eye infection.  Gentle Cleaning:  Use a damp, soft cloth to gently clean around the eyes. Be cautious not to touch the eyeball directly. This helps remove any dirt or debris that may accumulate, maintaining clear and healthy eyes.  Consultation with Vet:  If tear stains persist or the eyes appear irritated, consult your vet. They can provide guidance on potential underlying issues and recommend suitable solutions or treatments.  Sun Protection:  Frenchies, with their prominent eyes, can be sensitive to sunlight. Consider providing shade or using dog-friendly sunglasses to protect their eyes during sunny days.  Regular Eye Checks:  Incorporate regular eye checks into your grooming routine. Look for any redness, swelling, or changes in the eyes. Early detection of issues allows for timely intervention.   Caution:  If you need to use any eye-cleaning products, choose those specifically recommended by your vet.   "

Skin Health: Nurturing a Comfortable and Resilient Coat,"8. Skin Health: Nurturing a Comfortable and Resilient Coat  Let's explore the nuances of maintaining your Frenchie's skin health:   Signs of Allergies:  Monitor for signs of allergies, such as itching, redness, or inflamed skin. Allergies can manifest through various symptoms, and if you observe persistent issues, consult your vet to identify and address the underlying cause.   Sun Protection:  Frenchies can be sensitive to sunlight. Protect their exposed skin areas like their nose, tip of the ears, groin , and belly by applying dog-friendly sunscreen. This is crucial, particularly during sunny outings.   Addressing Dry Skin:  If you notice signs of dry skin, consider using a humidifier in dry environments which can contribute to maintaining an optimal level of moisture for your Frenchie's skin.  Moisturizing Paw Pads:  Why: The paw pads of your Frenchie are susceptible to dryness and cracking, especially in certain weather conditions. Moisturizing helps maintain the natural hydration levels, preventing discomfort and potential issues related to dry or damaged paw pads.  When: Moisturize your french bulldog's paw pads as needed, with a focus on times when the weather is harsh, such as during hot summers or cold winters. Additionally, if you notice signs of dryness or cracking, it's an indication that moisturization is required.   Importance:  A healthy coat begins with healthy skin. By focusing on your Frenchie's skin health, you contribute to their overall comfort and well-being.    "

Frenchie-Specific Tips: Tailoring Care for Your Unique Companion,"9. Frenchie-Specific Tips: Tailoring Care for Your Unique Companion  French Bulldogs come with their own set of characteristics and quirks, and tailoring your care routine to their specific needs ensures a happy and healthy furry friend.  Understanding Their Wrinkles:  Frenchies are known for their adorable wrinkles, especially on their face. While these folds contribute to their cuteness, they can trap moisture and become a breeding ground for bacteria. Gently clean between the wrinkles during baths and keep these areas dry to prevent skin issues.  Temperature Sensitivity:  Due to their brachycephalic (short-nosed) structure, Frenchies are sensitive to extreme temperatures. Be mindful of hot weather, as they can easily overheat. Ensure they have access to shade and water during outdoor activities.    Tailored Diet:  French Bulldogs may have specific dietary needs, and some are prone to allergies. It's also crucial to maintain a healthy weight to avoid added stress on their joints.  Moderate Exercise:  While Frenchies enjoy playtime, their brachycephalic nature means they may struggle with excessive exercise, especially in warm weather. Balance play and rest, and avoid strenuous activities during peak temperatures.  Regular Vet Check-ups:  Due to their breed characteristics, regular veterinary check-ups are crucial. Keep vaccinations up to date and discuss any breed-specific health concerns with your vet.  Tail Pocket Care:  Some Frenchies have a tail pocket, a small fold near the base of the tail. Ensure this area is kept clean and dry to prevent irritation and infections.   Sensitivity to Stress:  Frenchies can be sensitive to stress and changes in routine. Provide a stable and comfortable environment, and be mindful of any signs of stress, such as changes in behavior or appetite.      "

Positive Reinforcement: Nurturing Trust and Cooperation,"Creating a positive grooming experience for your French Bulldog is not only essential for their well-being but also fosters a strong bond between you and your furry companion. Let's explore the principles of positive reinforcement in grooming:  Start Slow and Gentle:  Introduce grooming gradually, especially if your Frenchie is new to the process. Begin with short sessions, focusing on areas they are comfortable being touched, and gradually progress to more sensitive areas.  Use Treats and Affection:  Reward your Frenchie dog with treats and affection during and after grooming. Positive associations make the experience enjoyable, and your Frenchie will be more likely to cooperate in the future.  Praise and Encouragement:  Offer verbal praise and encouragement throughout the grooming process. Use a soothing and cheerful tone to reassure your Frenchie, creating a positive atmosphere.  Create a Grooming Routine:  Establish a regular grooming routine, so your Frenchie becomes familiar with the process. Consistency builds confidence and reduces anxiety associated with grooming.  Association with Play:  Incorporate playtime before or after grooming sessions. This not only makes the grooming experience more enjoyable but also helps expend excess energy, making your Frenchie more cooperative.  Introduce Tools Gradually:  If your Frenchie is wary of grooming tools, introduce them slowly. Let them sniff and investigate the tools before using them. Use positive reinforcement when the tools are near, associating them with positive experiences.  Listen to Their Cues:  Pay attention to your Frenchie's body language. If they show signs of stress or discomfort, take a break and reassess. Understanding their cues and respecting their boundaries builds trust.  Short and Positive Sessions:  Keep grooming sessions short and positive, especially initially. Gradually increase the duration as your Frenchie becomes more accustomed to the process.  Grooming as Bonding Time:  Position grooming as a bonding experience. Engage with your Frenchie during grooming, talking to them gently and maintaining eye contact. This connection strengthens your relationship.  Avoid Negative Associations:  Avoid scolding or punishing your Frenchie during grooming. Negative experiences can create fear and reluctance. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement to encourage cooperation.  Importance:  Positive reinforcement not only makes grooming more enjoyable for your Frenchie but also builds trust and cooperation. It sets the foundation for a positive relationship centered around care and attention.  Caution:  If your Frenchie shows persistent signs of distress or anxiety during grooming, consider seeking guidance from a professional dog trainer or behaviorist. Tailoring your approach to your Frenchie's comfort level ensures a positive and stress-free grooming experience.    By incorporating these grooming practices into your routine, you'll not only maintain your Frenchie's health but also strengthen the bond between you and your delightful canine companion. Remember, each Frenchie is unique, so tailor your grooming approach to their individual needs and preferences."

Give your Rottweiler The ‘Once Over’ First  Before you start with the brushing and cleaning, run your hands over your puppy or dog.When giving your dog a once over, look for:   lumps, bumps, skin tags, or growths  foreign objects like splinters or burrs  cuts, scrapes, or any open wound  heat and signs of pain, such as if your dog does not want you to touch an area  parasites such as ticks or fleas  redness or inflammation, particularly under the arms, on the belly, between the toes, or in the ears  elbow calluses or other calluses on pressure points  dark red or brown, yellow, or green discharge from the eyes and ears.  Excessive ear wax  broken, damaged, brittle, or overgrown nails,  Redness, ingrown hairs, or anything unusual between the toes and paw pads  Pimples or blackheads.     Rottweilers are a breed that tends to suffer from canine allergies . An allergic reaction to something (even if it’s ‘internal’ such as an allergy to a food ingredient) usually shows up on their skin! The most common skin infection in Rottweiler’s is the hot spot.  Hotspots are smelly, round open sores. They usually happen if the skin is damaged, such as when your dog scratches themselves too hard. So the itchiness caused by allergies can cause hot spots.  Also, look inside the ears to make sure they’re clean and not red or irritated. Check all four paws for any cuts, thorns, torn nails etc. and make sure his nails are short.  Open their mouth and look at their teeth and gums. Anything lodged between his teeth, any red or inflamed areas, tartar build-up or tooth decay will need treatment and may be a sign of gum disease.

Understand your Rottweiler’s coat and hair growth cycle  Rottweilers have a double coat, which means a coarse outer coat and a softer, denser undercoat. A Rottweiler’s undercoat provides insulation against hot and cold weather, and the outer coat, called the guard hairs, helps repel water and dirt.  Shaving the coat can damage it, as the undercoat grows faster than the outer guard hairs. So when the coat regrows, it may not leave enough space for the guard hairs. This creates a patchy, damaged coat.  A Rotties coat grows in a seasonal hair-growth cycle . And the hair grows in four phases:   The anagen stage: The hair follicle is growing new hair  The catagen stage: The hair stops growing  The telogen phase: The hair follicle rests.  The exogen phase: the old hair is shed.   From this, you can see why your Rottweiler sheds seasonally. This whole hair growth cycle lasts about four months before the hair follicles start to shed the old hair in the undercoat. The guard hairs take a little longer. So a Rottweiler is programmed to shed roughly every four months, and usually, the hair growth cycle is a little longer in the winter .  The hair follicle is the pore that produces both the keratin for new hair and the sebum that moisturizes and nourishes the hair and skin. Just like with humans, it can get clogged, causing pimples, ingrown hairs, blackheads and more. Brushing your Rottweiler regularly helps spread this sebum over the coat and skin to nourish it while encouraging blood flow to the skin to help circulation.   "
3,https://www.a-love-of-rottweilers.com/your-guide-to-rottweiler-grooming.html,Your Complete Guide To Rottweiler Grooming,Can you Shave a Rottweiler?,"Can you Shave a Rottweiler?  A lot of people ask whether it’s okay to shave a Rottie, and the answer is usually ‘no’. It’s not good for their skin and doesn’t help cool them down in hot weather. In fact, it could make things worse because the double coat provides important protection from both heat and UV rays.  Another problem with shaving a Rottweiler is that the undercoat grows faster than the outer coat. So they can squeeze out the guard hairs, leaving a patchy and uneven coat.  If you have to shave your Rottweiler for any reason (perhaps he’s going into surgery and you’re worried about hair getting into the wound), try not to shave him too close to the skin.  It can take a Rottweiler three to four months to fully regrow their coat after they are shaved, so try to never dog this.  Also, make sure you use a good quality dog shampoo and conditioner afterward to rehydrate his skin and coat. "

The Safari Pin & Bristle Brush with Wood Handle is one I would personally recommend. Use the bristle side for the first few sessions, and be very gentle. It’s more to help the pup get used to the feeling of being brushed than actually to remove the shedding hair!  For an older pup or dog familiar with the grooming routine, a regular slicker brush (such as the Miracle Coat Slicker Dog Brush ) is a good choice.  There’s also a tool that I absolutely LOVE, and it’s amazingly effective on all my dogs, not just the Rottweilers. It’s called the FURminator . I think it’s the best Rottweiler grooming tool (or dog grooming tool even) around!  Always brush in the same direction that the hair grows, and start at the head and work downwards towards the tail.

But you need to gently lift the ear flap and ensure that the inside looks clean and healthy.  Dark, waxy build-up or red and inflamed membranes mean something wrong. If your pup or dog is showing any of these, then get him to a veterinarian for a check-up. A lot of head shaking means they may have an ear infection, a foreign object or obstruction in the ear canal, or ear mites.  Again, allergies can affect your dogs’ ears, making them sore, itchy, and red, often causing secondary ear infections called otitis. However, allergies are not the only reason a dog may get ear infections. Other causes include:   Bacterial and fungal infections  Ear mites  Autoimmune diseases like Pemphigus or Lupus  Endocrine disorders like Cushing’s disease, diabetes, or hypothyroidism  Foreign objects like water after a swim create a moist environment.   So if your dog has a problem with ear infections, be sure to look for underlying causes.  You can gently wipe out the inside of your Rottie’s ears (just what you can see… don’t probe any further!) with a cotton pad moistened in warm water, or try a gentle, soothing Ear Relief Wash . "

They are more gentle and won’t strip his natural oils.  While your Rottweiler is a puppy, you can bathe them in the tub quite effectively. Once they weigh closer to 80lbs than 8lbs, it won’t be quite so straightforward.  Because of that, if you have a walk-in shower, it may be a good idea to get them used to be showered rather than bathed (I speak from experience!).  AquaPaw has an excellent dog shower head to help groom your dog – check it out .”  Either way, just make sure the bottom of the tub or shower stall has a non-slip mat. This will make him feel more secure, prevent injuries, and use warm but not hot water.  Keep shampoo away from his eyes and excess water out of his ears.

If your puppy or dog has nails that are too long, it will interfere with how he walks and cause discomfort. They are also more at risk of ripping or tearing when they’re long, which can be very painful for your Rottie. Overgrown nails also strain a dog’s bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons by pushing the toes into unnatural angles. This can cause arthritis and even ligament tears.  Because they are basically black dogs, a Rottweiler’s nails are black too. This means that it’s a bit trickier to cut them than it would be if the nails were light-colored as they are on dogs with lighter coats.  Here’s a video with tips and tricks for trimming a Rottweiler’s dark nails:  "

They’re actually a good choice at first, as they don’t look scary or make much noise when cutting. But, as your pup gets older, you’ll need something a bit more heavy-duty. I’d recommend getting some proper canine nail clippers, such as Hawatour Dog Nail clippers .  It’s also a good idea to have some styptic powder on hand. If you cut a little too close to the ‘quick’ (a blood vessel that runs through the nail), it can bleed quite a bit. Kwik-Stop Styptic Powder applied to the cut end of the nail will stop the bleeding immediately.  When nail clipping, your best bet is just to cut the very tip of the nail at first. Don’t go higher than where the nail starts to curve. That way, you should be fine.  Alternatively, you can try a nail grinder or dremel to file down your dog’s nails rather than actually cutting them. These are popular with some dog owners, and you can go very slowly and carefully so that there’s less chance of cutting the quick. These grinders can be a bit noisy.  If you plan to use one of these, just grind for a few seconds at a time. Build up gradually so your dog can get used to the strange noise and ‘feel’ of it on his paws.  Look at the Oster 78129-600 Gentle Paws Cordless Nail Trimmer to see if you’d like to add one of these handy tools to your Rottweiler grooming arsenal.  Professional Rottweiler grooming  If you’re unsure about tackling the grooming yourself or don’t have the time, then take your Rottweiler to a professional grooming appointment.  Most dog groomers have experience in dealing with all different types and sizes of dogs and will know how to handle even the most uncooperative of customers!  A professional grooming session will usually last around an hour. Your Rottie will have a thorough brush-out, shampoo and condition (if required), clock his nails, and any other areas that need attention.  Your groomer may also be able to give you some tips on how to care for your dog’s coat at home and what type of products to use.  If you do decide to use a professional groomer, it’s a good idea to find one that is qualified and experienced and who uses only the best products available.  You may even want to take a look at some online reviews before making your decision."

Get the Right Tools  Image Credit: KPad, Shutterstock  When you’re taking care of a Husky, it is important to buy the right tools to keep their coats in tip-top shape.  You’re going to be battling quite a conflict in your house over fur problems. The Husky is a double-coated breed, meaning they have an outer coat and an undercoat that shed continuously year-round. You will need the proper tools to help combat this shedding and maintain the health of their coat.  Some tools that it helps to have on hand when grooming a Husky include:    Comb to work through mats   Bristle brush to smooth the coat and add shine   Slicker brush to detangle and smooth the outer coat   Undercoat rake (de-shedding tool) to remove loose fur from the undercoat   Dog shampoo and conditioner for bathing    More details on these types of tools can be found below.

Prepare a Routine  You will need to have a timed routine of care. Whether you brush every evening before bed or give your pup a few passes during the day when you think about it, try to keep it as an everyday event.  Not only will this get your dog used to being groomed, but it will also keep shedding to a minimum, not letting it build up in the coat.  Note that the slicker brush and comb can be used daily. But the undercoat rake should only be used 1–2 times per week. Because it reaches so closely to your dog’s skin, it can irritate the skin if used too often.  In general, you should only bathe a Husky once every 4–6 weeks, but you can bathe them weekly if they spend a lot of time outside and get dirty. Just make sure not to bathe them too often, because overbathing can dry out their skin.  "

",Grooming During Shedding Season:,"Grooming During Shedding Season:  German Shepherds are sometimes called, “German Shedders!” That will tell you all you need to know about their grooming requirements during the shedding season!  When your dog is shedding in the spring and fall, you’ll need to brush them every day. You will notice many more loose hairs during the shedding seasons.  Heavy shedding happens in spring to allow the dog to get rid of their winter coat so that they will not overheat during the warmer weather.  In the fall, the lightweight summer fur is shed to make way for the dog’s thick winter coat.  Indoor-dwelling German Shepherds may not shed as heavily as outdoor dogs.  That’s because your central heating and living in your house will keep your dog nice and warm, negating the need for the thick underfur that an outdoor living dog would need.  Many German Shepherd owners report that their long-haired dog sheds less than their short-haired relatives. But why is that? Well, the reason for this odd phenomenon is that the German Shepherd’s fluffy undercoat gets trapped by the longer outer fur as it sheds, making excessive shedding halt.  That means less hair on your furniture, but it also makes your dog more susceptible to developing mats in their coat. Also, although a short-haired German Shepherd is less prone to matting, you will find more of their hair on your clothes and carpets.  Therefore, both long and short-haired German Shepherds require plenty of grooming, although for different reasons.  Grooming your German Shepherd is an important aspect of being a responsible pet owner. Regular brushing, bathing, trimming, nail trimming, and teeth brushing will keep your dog looking and feeling their best. Remember to not harm their natural oils by over grooming your German Shepherd regularly.  You won’t find much variety in hairstyles for your German shepherd. When it comes to looking (and feeling) good, it’s more about being properly brushed and groomed, and whether their coat is shiny and healthy. If you truly feel the need to trim your pup, purchase a pair of grooming scissors and give them very specific snips that won’t affect the rest of their gorgeous coat. With the proper grooming tools and techniques, you'll be able to keep your German Shepherd looking great and feeling comfortable.  Remember, German Shepherds shed, a LOT. From loose fur to dog hair on your clothes and furniture, you will need to invest in the proper de shedding tools and best brushes to combat grooming time in breeds that shed year round. "

Brush Their Hair Regularly  Regardless of the dog breed, brushing the coat regularly is vital to keep a canine’s fur glossy and shiny. How often you brush the coat will depend on the texture and length of your dog’s coat.  For long-haired breeds, like Collies and Golden Retrievers, you must brush their hair at least once a week. Or you could brush them every other day if you think it’s necessary.  Since Collies are long-haired, they are prone to mat formation. Mats are clumps of tangled fur that can be painful and uncomfortable for the dog. If your Collie has mats in its fur, it will lick or bite itself at the location of the mats because it feels irritated. Excessive biting or licking can cause skin infections.  Foreign bodies, such as grass seeds or pollen, may also hide inside your dog’s fur mats. Sometimes, they burrow deep into the skin and form an abscess or a pocket of pus.  Besides removing mats, regular brushing also helps remove dirt, dander, and loose hair from the dog’s coat. It helps extend the time between subsequent baths.

Use Husbandry Training  Zookeepers use husbandry training to make large animals, including predators, comfortable with the idea of grooming. They often use positive reinforcement to make the animals see grooming as fun.  Does your Border Collie throw a fit whenever you try to groom them? Husbandry training can be your savior.  Use these tips to make your dog accustomed to grooming activities:    Get Them Used to Your Hands : If you are your dog’s primary groomer, they need to get used to your hands touching it. You can make a pup comfortable by handling their body parts from the ears and tail to the toes. Starting at a younger age will give you a better chance of training your dog.   Move to Sensitive Areas: Once your dog gets used to your touch, you can move to sensitive areas, like the face and paws. You can gently brush your dog’s fur as you move from one body part to another.   Let Them Do Their Nails: Yes, you read that right! You can teach your dog to “file” its nails by taking them for walks on rough surfaces. However, you still might need to clip them from time to time.    "

Make Them Comfortable Around Nail Clippers  Some dogs start to run away the second you pull those nail clippers out. When you expose them to it from a young age, use plenty of treats and positive reinforcement, and get them used to having their paws touched, this makes it a lot easier when it comes time to clip those long nails.

Trim Their Hair As Needed  Border Collies have a lot of hair. And it needs frequent trimming. Most dog owners take their dogs to the groomers for haircuts. But you can do little trims at home, especially around the eyes and paws. It’s important to remove the hair surrounding the eyes, as it can obstruct your dog’s vision.  If you have trained your Border Collie to be used to your touch, you shouldn’t have trouble trimming their hair at home. Wait for your dog to be calm and composed. It’s better if the dog is lying down while you cut their hair.  Remember that there’s a risk of cutting your dog with scissors if you’re feeling nervous or anxious. If you’re not confident, it’s better to take your dog to a professional groomer.  "

Trim Their Nails Regularly and Know How to Do It  A Border Collie’s nails should not exceed 2mm or 0.08 inches. If your dog’s nails touch or click against the floor, it’s time for a trim.  Here’s how to safely trim Collie’s nails:    Hold your dog’s paw firmly and put your thumb on the toe pad. Keep your forefinger on the skin above the nail with a gentle grip. When cutting, ensure their fur is not in the way.  Extend the nail by pushing your thumb upward and backward on the toe pad while moving your forefinger forward.  Clip the nails’ tips only in a straight across motion. Also, get the dewclaws, which are located on the inner side of your pup’s legs.    Pay attention to the quick, which is a pinkish vein in the nail. If your Collie’s nails are white, look for the little dots inside. Avoid cutting them too close to the quick because it can make your dog bleed.  Image Credit By: Ermolaev Alexander, Shutterstock  "

Grind Their Nails If They Don’t Like Clippers  You should grind your dog’s nails at least once every 3 to 4 weeks if they don’t take well to the clippers. Grinding helps smooth out the sharp edges of the nails, keeping them at a safe length. Here’s how to do it:    Use a nail grinder tool designed specifically for dogs. It consists of a spinning head with an emery band or sanding drum.  Get your dog in a comfortable position and hold the toe firmly.  Grind the nail from the bottom and move to the tip slowly.  Smooth out rough edges, but go in small strokes, grinding only small sections at a time.    Border Collies have long hair, so you must keep their fur back while grinding. Otherwise, there’s a risk of the grinder getting caught in your dog’s hair.  "

Perform Monthly Skin Checks  A skin check is an integral part of grooming a Border Collie. You should check your pet’s skin for signs of infection, worms, or mats at least once a month. Keep a notebook to record your findings so you can share them with the vet on your next visit.  Start by getting your dog in a comfortable position. You can make your Collie perch on a counter or elevated surface to get a clear view of the whole body.  Here are some places to check:   Inside the ears  Between the skin folds, especially of the lips and the face  Between the toes  Behind the ears  In the armpits  Under the tail  Under the back legs  In the skin under the hair  Under the belly  At junctions where haired and non-haired skin meets (lips, anus, paw pads, nose bridge)    Look for signs of skin thickening, bumps, and lumps. If there’s any oozing, scaling, or scabs, that’s also a sign of concern. Measure and count the lumps if your dog has several of them. Notice if they grow in number or size over time.  You might also find parasites, such as lice, fleas, and ticks, in dog fur. Get your hands on a flea shampoo as soon as possible to prevent the problem from getting worse.

Here are some of them:   Moist or inflamed ears  Odd smell  Discharge from the ears    If a dog is usually calm but yelps or whines a lot when you try to check its ears, there could be an infection. Dogs with ear infections often scratch their ears and shake their heads excessively. Take your dog to the vet immediately if you notice any signs of an infection.

Bathe Them Every 3 Months  Border Collies do not need to be bathed as often as other breeds. A bath every 3 months should suffice. But if your pet likes to play in the mud, you might bathe them more frequently.  However, you shouldn’t overdo it. Bathing a Border Collie too often can remove skin-protecting oils, leading to irritation.  Here are some things to remember when bathing a Border Collie:    Brush Beforehand: Since Border Collies shed a lot, you should brush your pet’s coat before bathing. Otherwise, your bathtub might look like the floor of a hair salon.   Use Tepid Water: Anywhere from tepid to warm water is suitable for the bath. Do not use hot water, as it can dry out their skin, causing itching and irritation.   Use the Right Products: Use dog-grade conditioners, cleansing products, and shampoos. Do not share your shampoo with your pooch, no matter how good it smells.   Protect the Eyes : Make sure you protect your dog’s eyes during a bath. It’s no fun getting shampoo in the eyes.

Select the Right Shampoo  There’s a huge selection of dog shampoo to choose from. But you should know about these main types:     Flea Shampoo: These control fleas in dogs. You should only use this shampoo for a Border Collie if it has fleas.   Oatmeal Shampoo : If your dog has dry skin, try an oatmeal-based shampoo meant to soothe irritation.   Medicated Shampoo: These shampoos work wonders for dogs with hot spots, skin irritations, and dandruff. Consult a vet to find the right medicated shampoo for your Collie. Most of these shampoos contain hydrocortisone and coal tar for treating skin irritations.   Puppy Shampoo : If your Collie is still a pup, get a shampoo that does not make it tear up. These shampoos are called “tearless” because they do not irritate the eyes.   Hypoallergenic Shampoo: Border Collies with sensitive skin or skin conditions will need these shampoos.    Oatmeal-based shampoos are great for regular use. You can also add a conditioner to your dog’s grooming routine to make the coat shine.   Our Favorite Products  Selecting the right shampoo and conditioner makes the world of a difference when grooming your pup. Our favorite products are the duo by Hepper.

Do Not Forget Dental Hygiene  Brushing your Collie’s teeth twice a week should help keep its dental hygiene in check. Buy a specifically designed toothbrush with soft bristles, an angled handle, and multiple heads so that it can reach all the nooks in your dog’s mouth.  Do not use human-grade toothpaste for your dog, as it contains fluoride and xylitol, which are toxic for dogs. You can buy dog toothpaste in delicious flavors, like chicken, peanut butter, and beef.  Try different combinations to see which your dog likes best. Establish a tooth brushing routine to get them used to the process.  "

Create a Routine  Nothing gets a dog excited for grooming sessions like a routine. The more familiar everything is for your dog, the calmer they will be during trimming or bathing.  For baths, use the same bathing spot, shampoo , and conditioner. The water temperature should also be the same every time. It will help your pet feel safe and calm.  The same applies to other grooming activities too. For instance, you can choose a nail-trimming counter or table in your house. When you get them to this table, they will know they need to lie down and hold out their paws.  Image Credit By: Sebastian Quinn, Shutterstock  "

Get Professional Grooming  Border Collies have a double coat. Since the guard coat is longer than the undercoat, they need grooming every 8 weeks. During spring, when the dog sheds and changes coats, they will need monthly grooming.  If you are too nervous to do this at home, it is best to take the Border Collie to a professional groomer. You can find a reliable groomer in your area by checking online reviews or asking fellow pet owners for recommendations.           Conclusion  Grooming is an essential part of keeping your pet healthy and in good shape . Border Collies can have two types of coats: smooth and rough. Those with smooth coats require more grooming since they shed more frequently.  Both types also need to have their nails trimmed, ears cleaned, skin checked, and teeth brushed. When choosing grooming products for your dog, it’s crucial to steer clear of human-grade items, like shampoos and toothpaste.

While many people love the unique look of Manx cats, the lack of a tail can also contribute to certain health problems.  Manx cats don’t have a tail because of a mutation in a gene that’s labeled M. This gene causes the tail as well as the vertebrae near it to develop abnormally. All Manx cats have a mutant M gene and a normal m gene (written as Mm), with the mutant gene being dominant. Cats with two mutant genes (MM) die during early fetal development, which is why the Manx gene is sometimes called a lethal gene. 2  Manx cats can be born without a tail, with a stubby tail, or with a full-length tail. 3 Like Japanese Bobtail cats, Manx cats look similar to other domestic cats aside from their tails.

Cat care starts with understanding potential health risks and how to handle them, but it’s also about diet and nutrition, exercise, grooming, and more.  Diet & Nutrition  Manx cats — like all cats — are obligate carnivores , which means their diet consists of more than 70% meat. 5 This also means that they have a harder time digesting vegetables and other plant-based food sources.  Feeding your cat a healthy diet is essential, and that starts with choosing the right cat food. Your vet can help you select a brand that’s right for your Manx cat. The key is finding meat-based cat food that has all the nutrients your cat needs to be healthy, including amino acids, minerals, vitamins, fats, and fatty acids. Your vet may also recommend specialty cat food if your Manx cat has a weight problem or certain medical issues.  Grooming  While cats usually do a good job of grooming themselves, they still need a little help from time to time. Grooming can help prevent issues like matting and tangling, keeping your Manx cat’s coat healthy and shiny.  You can take care of your cat’s coat by brushing them a few times a week. Brushing your cat helps remove dead skin and loose hair, which can also help you prevent shedding.  Your Manx cat also needs a little maintenance during grooming, which includes nail trimming, eye cleaning, and ear cleaning. You should groom your cat about once a month, or you can take them to a vet if you’re not comfortable trimming their nails or cleaning their ears.  Exercise & Enrichment  Manx cats love to play and have fun, so it’s your job as a pet parent to make sure they get plenty of exercise and enrichment. You should play with your Manx cat for about 20-60 minutes each day to keep them entertained. You can invest in cat toys, lick mats, scratch mats, and cat trees. Supervised outdoor time is also a good way to let your Manx cat play, and catios give them a safe place to play and explore outside. As long as your cat gets some playtime each day, you’re doing a good job.  Preventative Care & Veterinary Check-Ups  Preventing medical problems is the best way to keep your Manx cat happy and healthy, and your vet can help. You should be taking your cat to the vet for annual check-ups to monitor their weight and check for general health problems. 6  Parasite prevention is also key, which means you need to give your cat preventative medication on a regular schedule.

The unique physical characteristics and charming behavior of Manx cats make them a popular choice among cat enthusiasts. From individual cat parents to families with small children, Manx cats typically make great pets.  Why do Manx cats not have tails?  Manx cats don’t have tails as a result of a genetic mutation. The mutant M gene dominates the regular m gene (written as Mm), which affects the way the tail and the connected part of the spine form. While most Manx cats don’t have tails, some do. Genetic mutations can cause Manx cats to have no tail, a stubby tail, or a full-length tail.  Are Manx cats low maintenance?  Manx cats are low maintenance in terms of grooming because they have short to medium-length coats. Manx cats don’t require a ton of grooming or other maintenance like long-haired breeds do. However, Manx cats are also susceptible to certain health problems, which can make them harder to care for.  "

Revolution Plus provides protection from six parasites, while Credelio and other similar medications are designed for fleas and ticks. You can talk to your vet to learn more about flea and tick prevention.  "

Selective breeding has led to cats with several coat characteristics ranging from the hairless Sphinx cats to fluffy, long-haired breeds. Some cats shed very little, such as the Sphinx and the Rex breeds. Most other breeds of cats have a smooth outer coat of guard hairs and a fine undercoat of soft hairs that provide additional insulation. Long-haired breeds of cats often have very fine silky outer coats that may tangle very easily.  NEED 4 Some cats that live in cooler climates, particularly if they frequently venture outdoors, undergo two heavy seasonal shedding cycles per year (late spring and late fall), during which much of the undercoat falls out in clumps. However, many cats that share our homes shed their undercoat and guard hairs at low levels all year round.  NEED 9"

If a tangle is small or relatively minor, or if your cat has just picked up a burr or grass awn, you may be able to remove it by brushing or combing it out gently. If the tangle is extensive or there is a large clump of burrs or grass awns forming a mat, it may be necessary to cut out the clump of hair. In this case, you need to be extremely CAREFUL that you do not accidentally cut your cat's skin. For this reason, scissors are never recommended, and clippers should be used. When tangles are severe or extensive, it is strongly recommended that you seek professional care from a groomer or your veterinarian. If a mat has caused any skin irritation, take your cat to your veterinarian so that the appropriate treatment can be prescribed.

Bathing cats can represent a significant challenge to many cat owners because few cats enjoy the experience. If you have a new kitten, you can teach him to tolerate baths by starting when she is young, but it can be difficult to train an adult cat to accept bathing as part of her grooming rituals. Many people choose to take their cat to a professional groomer for bathing or to arrange with their veterinarian to have him sedated and groomed at the veterinary clinic.  NEED 4 If you attempt to bathe your cat on your own, the bath water should always be warm, partly for the cat's comfort and partially because shampoos clean more effectively in warm water. Most people find the easiest way to bathe their cat is in the laundry tub, bathroom sink, or bathtub. Since few cats will sit still in a sink full of water, some groomers recommend 'dipping' the cat into the water to wet it down, then applying the shampoo and lathering it up while the cat is on dry ground. Ideally, you should rinse the shampoo or other products using running water, but many cats become frantic when put under a stream of water. If this is the case with your cat, you may find it easier to dip her into the water until all the soap is removed. When dipping a cat into water, it is important to hold onto all four feet, so she cannot escape, AND make sure you guard against personal injuries from teeth or nails!  NEED 4 After applying the shampoo, work it through the entire coat to remove all dirt and debris. Some owners of cats with particularly thick coats find that it is best to dilute the shampoo in some water so that it is easier to apply and rinse out. For routine bathing, you can rinse the shampoo out right away, but if you are using a medicated shampoo, it must sit on the coat for 5-10 minutes before being rinsed out. Make sure you read the instructions on the shampoo label for the specific product you are using or follow your veterinarian's directions if you use a medicated shampoo.  NEED 4 Once the shampoo has done its job, it must be thoroughly rinsed out. For best results, a conditioning product should be applied afterward to restore any lost moisture to the skin and minimize the development of dandruff after the bath. Since your cat WILL groom itself vigorously after the bath, it is important to rinse out all traces of shampoo or other products. This is even more important if you are using a medicated shampoo or a flea shampoo to avoid any risk of toxicity to your cat.  NEED 8"

",Why add extra fruits and veggies to your pet's diet?,"Why add extra fruits and veggies to your pet's diet?  One of the best ways to ensure that your pet is getting all the nutrients they need is to feed them a diet that includes fresh fruits and vegetables. Not only are these foods packed with vitamins and minerals , but they also contain fibre, which is essential for good digestive health.  Fruits and vegetables provide vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, manganese, and boron. These nutrients help maintain strong immune systems by fighting off infection-causing bacteria before they can take hold in your pet's body.   Just like the food we eat, over-processing fruits and veggies can cause them to lose nutrients. Adding them fresh to meals will increase these nutrients and have them readily available for absorption.  You can feed your pet fruits and vegetables as part of their regular diet or as a healthy treat. There are a wide variety of fruits and vegetables that you can feed your pet, but some are better than others. For example, dark leafy greens like spinach and kale are packed with nutrients like iron, calcium, and vitamins A, C, and K.  Other great options include carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, apples, and berries. Let's take a look at some of the most popular options.  FRUITS  Fruits digest at a different rate, using different enzymes, than vegetables and meat.  The rule of thumb is to feed fruit at least one hour before feeding meat or other proteins, and a minimum of three hours after a protein meal . This is because fruit digestion on its own is fast. When you feed fruit with protein, it sits in the stomach much longer, which may lead to undesirable fermentation and the production of a small amount of alcohol.  They are a great treat for training (berries especially!) if you don't have any packaged ones on hand. "

Romaine and other leafy greens are fine for dogs but cats should only get one teaspoon of greens per day because they're sensitive to oxalates, which can lead to urinary tract issues if eaten regularly. The same goes for citrus fruits like lemons/limes because their acids may irritate their stomachs.  This blog post discusses dangerous foods as well as food additives that can be fatal. "

",Cooked bones,"Cooked bones  Cooked bones are a common ingredient in many pet foods. The idea behind cooked bones is that they're more digestible than raw ones, but this isn't always true--cooked bones can be more dangerous for your dog or cat if not prepared properly.  Cooked bones can splinter easily and cause blockages in your pet's digestive tract when they get stuck in the throat or esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach). If you've ever seen someone try to swallow a piece of chicken bone at Thanksgiving dinner, then you know how painful this can be!  Cooked bones can also cause choking and respiratory problems if they enter your pet's lungs. If you're worried about your dog or cat getting the right nutrition from their food, look for a product that contains raw bones instead of cooked --you'll know it's safe to feed them to your pets. "

",Cooked foods,"Cooked foods  Cooked foods are dangerous for your pet. They can cause pancreatitis, diarrhea, anemia, malnutrition, and cancer. Cooking destroys most vitamins/minerals which makes them less available for absorption into our bodies.    Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas caused by high fat levels in the blood. This can happen when your dog eats too many fatty foods such as bacon or sausage.    Diarrhea occurs when bacteria in the intestine are killed off by cooking processes that use high heat but not necessarily when food has been baked at lower temperatures for longer periods.    Anemia is a condition where there isn't enough red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body--and this means they need iron!    TIPS  Here are some tips to help you add fresh food to your pet's diet:  1. Start slowly and increase the amount of fresh food gradually . This will give your pet time to adjust to the new diet and help them avoid digestive issues.  2. Make sure that the fresh food you are feeding your pet is free of toxins and chemicals . Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before feeding them to your pet.  3. Feed your pet a variety of different foods to guarantee they are getting all the nutrients they need. Include a mix of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and herbs in their diet.  4. Store fresh food properly to keep it from going bad: in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. "

",Conclusion,"The best way to get your pet the nutrients they need is by adding fresh foods to their diet. By doing this, you can increase the amount of vitamins and minerals that they receive from food sources. However, if the portion of fresh food exceeds 20% of the overall diet long term, then the fresh food portion will need to be nutritionally balanced or serve a vitamin supplement to guarantee a complete nutrient profile.  If this all sounds like too much to track for every meal-time, PureForm makes it easy to serve vitamins and minerals in a powdered food topper. Try PureForm Essentials (or Development for puppies) today to give their food a boost and ensure they get all they need — without you having to do the math.  Until next time, Happy Supplementing!"
